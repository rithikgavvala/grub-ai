My 3 year old son needed a haircut this past summer and the lure of the $7 kids cut signs got me in the door. We had to wait a few minutes as both stylists were working on people. The decor in this place is total garbage. It is so tacky. The sofa they had at the time was a pleather sofa with giant holes in it. And my son noticed ants crawling all over the floor and the furniture. It was disgusting and I should have walked out then. Actually, I should have turned around and walked out upon entering but I didn't. So the older black male stylist finishes the haircut he was doing and it's our turn. I tell him I want a #2 clipper around the back and sides and then hand cut the top into a standard boys cut. Really freaking simple, right? WRONG! Rather than use the clippers and go up to actually cut the hair, he went down. Using it moving downward doesn't cut hair, it just rubs against it. How does this man who has an alleged cosmetology license not know how to use a set of freaking clippers??? I realized almost immediately that he had no idea what he was doing. No idea at all. After about 10 minutes of watching this guy stumble through it, I said \"you know what? That's fine.\", paid and left. All I wanted to do was get out of that scummy joint and take my son to a real haircut place.\n\nBottom line: DO NOT GO HERE. RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!!!","date":"2013-12-07 03:16:52"}

We were not disappointed.\n\nI am a bit of an amateur chef myself and consider my palate to be fairly sophisticated when it comes to all kinds of South Asian cuisine. This is not authentic Indian food - we don't have rice and salad bowls - but it is good, wholesome, high quality Indian food.\n\nI ordered a bowl of rice, yellow daal and the koftas (meatballs). The daal was perfect, the way daal should be cooked. The koftas were a little bland for my taste, but otherwise not bad...soft and the right texture. Paired with the many sauces and onions and the whole dish was wholesome and rich and very filling. My friend ordered the biryani, which, while not bad, still isn't the way real biryani should be, and I come from a city known for its biryani - but then I still haven't found a single place in America that makes biryani the way they do it back home.\n\nThe ambiance is good and there's plenty of room to sit. The line moves quickly and at most you'll face a 10-15 min wait on a crowded day. The only issue I had was with the music - being a designer, it bothers me that the music selection to go with such great interiors  could have been better...I would expect Bollywood classics or Indian classical fusion instead of the usual loud pop music.\n\nTldr: if you're looking for authentically prepared and presented Indian food you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for high quality Indian-American food, this is a great place to get it. Will be coming back to try their tikka masala and chicken next.\n\nUpdate: went there again with a bunch of friends and tried their chicken tikka masala and pav bhaji. This is hands down the best Indian place in Pittsburgh - the bhaji is to die for. Make sure you sprinkle lemon on top and have the pav with mango chutney.","date":"2018-02-01 19:15:00"}

I was hungry and Caesars Palace was a across from where I was staying and all the restaurants in my hotel were packed and had lines, I walked right in with no waiting. (I will assume now that since its Bobby's place this place can get crowded so I feel the need to note this was a Sunday about 11:45am) Once inside Caesars Palace, I went to the first restaurant I saw, which was this one.  I realized mid-meal it was his restaurant when the waiter at the table next to me was explaining to the recently seated couple that \"Mr Flay likes a little spice so beware all of our dishes have a little kick\" (they were an older couple). I know i'm slow after he said that, that's when i realized why they had his cookbooks in the front. :)  (but like i said had a horrible trip so i wasn't even looking for things like this) anyway onto the food.\n\nFOOD: fantastic.  I went on sunday and i got the eggs and aged striploin tortilla (fancy name for steak and eggs) and  it was yummy.  It came with all this spices of sorts (well they werent spices). I am not really sure how to describe it, more like the consistency of salsa's but they werent salsa's, at any rate it was really good mix with the eggs.  I had a side of home fries which were a little burnt but oh well.  The steak was very good, very flavored, moist and tender. Overall very good. Had a cappuccino too, also very good. I wish i had tried the crabcake's but i knew i wasnt going to eat all that. waiters were awesome, just the right amount of attentiveness.

Oh, how things have changed.\n\nThere are some goods, however.  If you are a conventioneer, you have instant and direct walking access to the main convention center.  But don't think about parking here for said conventions.  $30 a day for parking, Hilton?  Seriously?  That's robbery.  And greed.\n\nThe biggest disappointment is the killing off of Star Trek: The Experience over two years ago.  Despite this place being off-Strip, I made it a point to go here because they had such a fun and unique attraction here.  It would be one thing if they had something in mind to replace it, but either poor planning or the economy.... It's dead, Jim. \n\nThe \"Space Lounge\" is still there.  An entire casino area with a heavy sci-fi theme to it.  Except there's no casino here.  It's a huge space themed area with a ghost town bar, no slots, a few couches, a makeshift stage, beer signs, and a few remnants of Star Trek themes.  All of this space, and nothing.  No life to it.  Couches and beer signs only make the emptiness and waste of the area seem more empty and pathetic.\n\nWith their main draw gone, what has replaced it as the headliner?  Benihana's.  Nothing wrong with the restaurant, but it's hardly unique or exclusive, even in Vegas.  The Hilton has a Pizza Hut Express here too.  Maybe they should promote that as their \"big draw\" on the marquee as well.  A huge Benihana sign covers up the old entrance to Star Trek.  With couches pushed in front of the entryway.  Again, just sad, and I'll be a big man in saying that they kind of broke my heart getting rid of one of my most beloved hang-outs here.\n\nThe arcade is dead as well.  Another blanketed off space that sits and collects dust.  Again, with two-plus years, no suitable replacement has been found for anything in this section.  A few shops that fluctuate, but that's it.  This is a lot of dead space to go unused.  \n\nThere's also the issue of the Men's bathroom in the main casino area.  Above every urinal is a picture of a lust-crazed girl staring over your bits with a camera, magnifying glass, tape measure, etc, while you pee.  The first time I saw this, it was \"ha ha\" funny, then when the laughter died, it just turned creepy and weird for me.  I actually selected a urinal based off which girl creeped me out the least.  She merely looked like she was casting spells at my nethers.  I could live with that.\n\nLadies: I must know.  Is there something like this in the girl's restroom?  When you close the stall door to do your business, is there a picture of some crazed guy making grabbing motions where your boobs would be?  Please message me and let me know.  I'd really like to know what the Hell you get in your bathroom after my gender's discovery.\n\nAs critical as I am being, there looks to be some sort of steampunk-themed club called \"Triumph\" there.  I want to check this out.  Atonement for the death of my beloved Warp Core Breach booze bowl?  We'll see, but it's going to have to be pretty good to replace the hole in my heart from that much booze for so cheap a price.\n\nThe sad part is, Hilton's one of those \"history rich\" casinos here.  Look up the history on this place.  A lot of awesome stars and vintage Vegas stuff happened here, which makes you wonder why this isn't represented more.\n\nThis place is great for convention visitors to stay, but that's about it as far as I can see.  They need to figure themselves out for everything else.","date":"2011-01-09 00:09:50"}

I went to Huntersville Ford yesterday to get an oil change on my commuter car.  Paid my $41.00 and was given back my car just over an hour later.\nToday I had to go to work (40 mile round trip commute).  As I was getting off of I-85, I noticed the smell of burning oil.  I thought maybe the tech just spilled a little on the exhaust manifold since it's right there, and maybe it's burning off.  I didn't hit a stop light until I was almost at my office.  When I stopped and was waiting for the light, my cabin started to fill with smoke, and I had smoke pouring out from under the hood and the wheel wells as well.\nI pulled over into the parking area of a gas station (because they have accessible fire extinguishers) and parked.  I popped the hood only to find THE TECHNICIAN DID NOT PUT THE OIL FILLER CAP BACK ON!!!  Now my engine is covered in potentially flammable oil, and of course Huntersville Ford is closed today!!!!\nI have my car sitting outside in the parking lot with the hood open, just in case it decides to ignite, because my engine is pretty hot after a 20 mile drive.\nI called and left a voicemail, and now I have to find a way to degrease my engine at work, just so I can drive it home in a less-flammable state.  I WILL HOLD HUNTERSVILLE FORD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COMPONENTS THAT FAIL AS OF A RESULT OF THIS.  Most electronics don't like being slathered in motor oil.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they aren't designed for that.\n\nAnd NO, I did not have other work done... Just the oil change.  You had 1 job.... oil change.  No transmission service, no brake service, no rotation, no cooling flush... just an oil change.

My daughter's go to is a strawberry banana smoothie and the menu had a few smoothies that had strawberry and banana mixed with other stuff and I asked if they would be able to make one with just strawberry and banana and she had said they couldn't because it was already pre made. So we continued to look at the menu and a different girl came and said she would be able to make the smoothie so thank you to her. My husband and I knew we wanted to get an acai bowl so as\nwe looked at the different options we found one we wanted to try but on the menu it had a pitaya and we asked if we could get it with acai instead but again was told that it was already pre made. So we went with one that was made with acai but it had blueberries which we don't like and we weee hesistant to ask if they would be able to leave them out since everything seemed to be pre made but my husband did ask and luckily she said they could leave it out. Whew! It wasn't a long wait to get our order. My daughter drank her smoothie saying it was okay and our acai bowl was okay as well. To\nme the best part was the granola and that's about it.

Every restaurant was packed before the show, so we set on wandering MGM afterwards for a good after show nosh and were definitely pleased at Crush. Luckily we were seated right away (not many people ordering dinner at 11pm I suppose!) and our incredibly nice server saw to our drink order ASAP.\n\nThe ambience is tres chic. Dark, romantic, and removed from casino craziness in the back where we sat cuddled up in a booth. The only negative about our seats was the pretty chilly draft, but perhaps we were just too sober ;) The Syrah was absolutely delicious, and at $11 for a glass, a Vegas bargain. We began with the Caesar salad which came out within minutes of ordering and was very tasty, though I myself found the sweetness to be a little strange. Overall it was a crunchy, refreshing delight. We then shared a margherita flatbread and the gnocchi. Whoa....both dishes definitely exceeded expectations. They were small plates, but really perfect for sharing. The speed at which the salad was delivered was slightly misleading, as the other dishes took quite a while to come out. However, they were clearly exceptionally fresh when they arrived.\n\nOur waiter was pretty busy but as attentive as he could be, and very professional without being overbearing. The end-to-end experience was more than I expected at such a large venue, and thus deserves a high recommendation. This was a perfect way to wind down from an energizing show without losing the dazzle of a getaway weekend with your honey.","date":"2014-08-10 23:03:05"}

I won't deny my dog needed some serious grooming.  We'd brushed him out the night before but he could still use more combing, his hind legs\/butt trimmed up and he had some matts behind his ear.  There are 4 doors at this place, I believe. If you just pull in to the drive way it's not terribly clear until you get closer to the doors and see signs directing you which to go into.  The lobby is cute. I was quickly greeted and I was given a form to complete. The woman doing the grooming introduced herself and I asked that his hind legs and butt get trimmed up and asked that she cut out any matts.  She said it would probably take about 3 hours.  I received a text about 3 1\/2 hours later stating the price would be $80 and if I returned within 8 weeks it would be $65.  I went to pick him up and I was shocked that they shaved him.  His hair was NOT that bad.  Not to mention the hair that was left was not soft as it has been after visiting other groomers.  I didn't say anything because I was so shocked in the moment so I took him home.  We saw our dog paying particular attention to his private area...more so than he usually does.  My husband looked closer and found that he had been nicked a couple of times.  We found a large cut behind one of his ears.  We won't be returning.","date":"2016-03-07 00:34:42"}

This review was tough to give, as it could've been anywhere between 2 and 4 stars.\n\nLet's start with the positives. I came here with a friend for Summerlicious this afternoon at 12:30, and we got the last seat in the restaurant (it helped that we reserved). We were given the menu and our order was taken in about 3-4 minutes. Not bad to start.\n\nI ordered the miso soup, green salad, ebi shiumai, sushi\/sashimi\/maki, and green tea ice cream. The miso soup and green salad tasted nothing special (the soup was a little salty though). The ebi shiumai tasted really good! The sushi\/sashimi\/maki tasted very good as well, and I especially love how there's a much higher raw fish-rice ratio compared to other restaurants I go to. Finally, the green tea ice cream was a great dessert to finish.\n\nEverything with the food satisfied me. The service, after having the order taken, was a near disaster. I understand it was a busy day today due to the fact it was a nice Friday, but many of the servers were confused in their roles. There was a long lineup of orders by the sushi counter, and at one point I saw 15 dishes lining up ready for serving, but no servers were going to pick them up. I didn't receive my shiumai until 1:00, and my sushi\/sashimi\/maki until around 1:20. I finished everything by around 1:30, but the ice cream didn't come until around 1:40, and finally the bill didn't come till around 1:55. After 1 hour and 35 minutes, I finally left the restaurant at 2:05, since I had to ask for the credit card machine, in which no server was around for about 8 minutes before I finally got one's attention.\n\nWhat probably saved this from a 2-star (or even a 1-star rating) was the fact the manager came out to me as I was signing my receipt saying how they were horribly understaffed and completely underestimated the demand for Summerlicious this year. They only had two sushi chefs, four servers, and two chefs serving what was a full house restaurant. In a way I felt bad, but I did give them just less than 10% tips; something I almost never do in restaurant.\n\nFree wifi! Password is the phone number. Perhaps as a sucker for free wifi that might have contributed to the 3-star rating I gave. However, be warned.","date":"2013-07-13 00:57:45"}

I ordered the hangover burger, and they not only asked how I wanted my burger (can choose from medium to well-done) but the worker even asked how runny I wanted the fried egg and then if I wanted it sunny side up or if they should flip it over easy. My buddy asked for mustard, and they even asked whether he wanted regular yellow, dijon, whole grain, or honey mustard. I added sweet potato fries for the $1 upcharge because I love sweet potato fries, paid my $10 and waited. I must say I was a little disappointed that I had to wait 15 minutes for the burger, but after first bite I had no more complaints!\nI don't know what's in Pat LaFreida's beef mixture, but it was the highest quality beef in a burger I've ever ordered. The bun was ridiculously soft as well. The egg was cooked perfectly, but the burger lacked any flavor from the small slice of cheese or the bacon hash unfortunately. Despite that, the amazing quality still made this burger awesome. \nThe sweet potato fries were by far the best sweet potato fries I've ever eaten, and I love sweet potato fries so that says a lot. They were crispy which so many places cannot accomplish and had a balance of sweetness from the fries and salt that was perfect. They came with a decent maple sauce, but I didn't dip very many because they were honestly better on their own. I must say, the bang bang sauce that comes on the side of the burgers is incredible though. It's similar to a Thousand Island dressing without the pickle relish, but something about it just makes it so much better and slightly sweeter. \nOverall, I probably wouldn't order the hangover again and would choose a more flavorful\/interesting option. I would also recommend going with a double if you're hungry because each patty is only around 4 ounces. Despite these slight \"drawbacks\", the quality of the meat and bun stood out so much that I think any burger here would be amazing and for a pretty solid price as well.","date":"2015-06-08 18:56:14"}

I went in, placed my order, and after about 15 minutes, was on my way home. \n\nThe inside is cozy, there is a new hookah lounge upstairs (not technically the same business), for those who might be interested in that. The tables inside were pretty low key, but the kitchen area is open except for some glass, so you get to watch your food prepared while you wait which is always a nice touch. Some people don't like that, but I do, it forces restaurants to practice more hygienic practices because customers can see more. \n\nThe young lady who rang me up was helpful and friendly. The gentleman who gave me my food, apologized for the wait (15 minutes is not long in my book, but maybe for some it is), and said that calling ahead is a great option if you're ever in a hurry in the future. \n\nI ordered a lamb and chicken shish kabob. They were both DELICIOUS. Many kabobs in this city are incredibly bland and under seasoned, definitely not the case here. The rice was also well flavored. The green sauce that was at the counter where you pick up your food was perfectly spiced and I put it on EVERYTHING! I appreciate the fresh lemon wedge that was included in my to-go container. \n\nMy only real complaint was the price. It was more than $17 for two kabobs, which I thought was on the expensive side. If they took their prices down around $2, I'd be here way more often that is good for my wallet...","date":"2016-03-06 23:58:31"}

The prime rib was balanced with just the perfect amount of richness and seasoning. I ordered a medium and it was a true medium- the edges were seasoned and done well while the interior was still a soft pink and juicy. My date loved the Yorkshire pudding, I wasn't really a fan, but it was airy and puffed up to perfection. The mushrooms were rich and earthy, the perfect accompaniment. The mashed potatoes were smooth, creamy, and deliciously well seasoned. No bland taters here.\n\nAll in all, we had a truly wonderful evening at Lawry's LV. We decided to skip dessert because we were stuffed and totally satisfied, so our waiter went the extra mile and boxed up a mini cake for us saying that we couldn't leave without something sweet on our anniversary (!!)

Really???? What a great way to handle an error in the production of the glasses.  When I objected to being relegated to reading with one eye with my new glasses, the reply was...\"Well, then you'll have to see the Dr. again, and no, he is not available now.\"  No offer to look up his schedule and see when I could see him again, or see if another Dr. could see me then to resolve it.  After the poor response to the problem (you would think they would have some professional way to deal with when glasses come back from the mfr\/lens maker and there is an unexpected issue).  I told them I'm not a patient here any longer and took my useless glasses home and resolved to find a quality optometry office and start over.  I did call back and spoke with an Office Mgr, who stated she would look into the matter and get back to me, but never did.  So I called again and toild them to toss my file out and not contact me again for any future appts. \n Another thing about their exams.....as part of your exam, they offer to take optional (extra cost) retina photos so you can also have a look at your retinas on a computer screen with the Dr., using a clumsy cube-shaped camera. You sit there and they have you smush your face up against a flat glass panel on the front while they take repeated attempts to get a good photo of your retina. They charge extra if you want this option. Then they raised the price, and I declined due to raising the price. They were charging plenty for that option already.  I moved to a different office that does not charge anything extra at all for the retina photos, and uses a better camera than the camera cube, so no more smushing my face against a flat glass window.\n(Note: using fake name here for privacy protection from internet identity thieves.)","date":"2018-07-17 00:21:32"}

We ate here on the day before New Year's Eve so that may have been why we easily got a reservation at prime dinner time.  Everything from start to finish was pretty much impeccable. \n\nSourdough bread in the shape of leaves were brought out immediately with softened butter in a small ramekin.  One thing I hate is when warm bread is brought out with butter that is ice cold and hard to spread on the bread, so I really appreciated that the butter was the right temperature to easily spread.\n\nFor a starter, we split the Terrine of foie gras which was delicious.  It has a thin layer of braised beef ground down to a coarse pate texture, then a thin layer of foie gras, then a layer of prune gelee.  Served with crostini and a small frisee salad.  The slightly slightly saltier beef and the creamy foie went so well together. The prune gelee added that touch of cool sweetness that made it all work together.  A dish I would definitely recommend.\n\nFor our entrees, I got the Steak frites, and Mark H had the Leg of lamb (Gigot d'Agneau.)  Mine was hangar steak topped with caramelized onions served with a compound butter and a healthy portion of nicely crispy, thinly cut fries.  The steak was cooked to a perfect mid rare and was tender.  The onions and the compound butter did overpower the steak a bit, though.\n\nMark H's dish on the other hand, was the better of the two.  The roasted leg of lamb was just so tender and flavorful,  the knife cut through the meat like butter.  The lamb was served with flageolet beans and braised escarole.  Our server asked him when he was ordering if he wanted any sides to go with it since it didn't come with a starch but the beans and escarole was enough for an entree portion.  Besides, I know he wanted to save room for dessert.\n\nFor dessert, we split the Banana crepe gateau.  Layers of crepes with banana pastry cream between them, served with salted caramel and french vanilla gelato.   This was pretty amazing as well.  I've had some fantasic gateau de crepes in france and this one really reminded me of being there.  The banana flavor was a bit too subtle for me but that salted caramel was like heaven.

The salmon salad came with a huge piece of fresh, healthy tasting salmon filet. It was just what I wanted. \n\nThe one wrinkle was that I wanted to swap something out of my salad for avocado instead (which came with the grilled shrimp salad but I wanted salmon, and not shrimp). The server told me they didn't do \"those kinds of substitutions\" but would check anyway. He came back, and affirmed that they couldn't put avocado on my salad unless they charged an extra $2.00. Kind of annoying. I get that if you're Terroni you can have a \"no substitutions\" policy but in this case, how about changing that policy? \n\nThe server really made an effort though, and said he'd bring over some guacamole instead.

Food was great, bummer no band due to Scottsdale rules but DJ is nice. Service ok but its busy on a Friday. I went again, food great as always but service still lacking. I figured its just busy. At this point I had gone 4 Friday nights in a row. Its close great food and I have always loved the Vig. \n\nI don't get why I have to wait so long to get a drink at the bar.

Good taste, good variety on the menu, priced fair. Why does it take so long to put in my dinner order? If I have been there 5-7 times, I have had to wait to order too long maybe 5 times. The food comes out quickly enough and luckily its good since the wait staff doesn't check back. \n\nMy friends and coworkers know I go out to eat quite a bit.

Far from the strip, which is good if you're not into partying and the Vegas nightlife.","date":"2016-01-17 19:42:47"}

I have heard that this place is good from my friends but I can't join them since there is nothing for vegetarian or vegan people to eat here. Vegetarianism is becoming more popular everyday and restaurants like this one have to learn to adapt and cater the needs and wants of people becoming vegetarians or vegans. Sadly, this is one of many restaurants who fail to understand this change. There are very few places where vegetarian or vegan people can have a proper meal. I'll come here only when there is a proper vegetarian\/vegan menu in place.","date":"2016-08-25 15:37:07"}

The original location was at about 52nd McDowell(it was a treat after squaw peak hike with da)( but they have been at the current location for probably the last 20 years. They have a good mix of North Indian and South Indian food. Masala dosas have always been one of my favorites things to get. The vegies and sambar are always fresh as well. The title may not say it here but they are just as famous for all the amazing sweets they make as well. Indians from all over town order it by the tray but if you arent sure what you want to order ask them to sample it. Jalebi barfi and laddu are some of my go to's. I'm an american born and raised indian so I'm suggesting some of the more tame whitewashed options. The service is quick and the staff is always attentive. You'll see an crowd of ASU kids definitely during cricket matches but they also have indian music videos playing throughout the day. Before I forget my favorite thing to get from there to go is pani puri!. Picture a cracker like hollow bubble with potatoes chickpeas and a spicy sauce. yes my mouth is watering just describing it.

Having tried two of the pastas and the gnocchi, my impression is that these dishes are the food version of jazz improv - discordant and overwhelming.  Like the music, I can see how the Pasta Bar dishes may appeal to many, particularly those who favor flavor intensity and\/or creativity over all else.  For my taste buds, this was overload.  Interesting yes, but I can't say I found it good.\nHere are some details:  \nPasta and gnocchi - both are quite heavy and substantial.  I prefer a more tender pasta and pillow-light gnocchi.  Maybe after running a marathon the high-density pasta would hold more appeal.\nSauces - Here is the in-your-face part.  The gnocchi sauce is spicy, overwhelmingly so for me (although I do freely admit to being a hot chili wimp).  Despite my personal intolerance to hot food, a more delicate approach would have been better.\nThe le Sarde sauce sounded interesting, mainly because I love sardines, but my taste buds could not get over the bizarre combination of strong flavors vying for attention. I could not even pick out the taste of the sardines amongst the culinary noise.  And what is with the dried hunks of bread?  I could not get beyond the oddness of this one.  \nThe carbonara was an intense combination of garlic and black pepper flavors, and probably the dish I enjoyed most of the three.  Even on this one, the garlic was out of this world in intensity.\nOn the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.  The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.  The ingredients all appeared fresh and high quality.  And the food is indeed interesting - this is no boring spaghetti\/lasagna place.\nAs a matter of taste, I'm going to have to pass on Pasta Bar.  For the price, I'll be looking for more of a flavor symphony.  If culinary improv and high-density pasta is your thing, check it out.","date":"2009-03-01 19:50:23"}

You know you're at home, but someone's moved something, rearranged the furniture, or otherwise changed things ever so slightly but just enough to make you suspicious. This wasn't the Epicure Cafe that I remember from three or four years ago.\n\nI learned from Jackie, our cutesy server who was a total dupe for actress Clea DuVall, that a few years ago Epicure changed locations. To a few doors down farther east on Queen, on the same side of the street. Which explains the slightly-different-but-not-quite layout, decor and seating. It was a pleasant surprise. I didn't venture upstairs but I was told there's an outdoor eating area that will have to be explored on my next visit.\n\nThe menu options are, like others have said, a bit overwhelming. But for the fussy eater (I was with one of them) there was no lack of choice - Epicure has everything from pasta (17 choices, including different sauces and shapes), burgers, pizza, wraps and another full page of duck\/veal\/lamb\/chicken options. I appreciate the selection but it could stand to be honed a little! Luckily Jackie was able to recommend favourites when we showed indecision. \n\nMy eyes went straight for the Pumpkin Ravioi ($14), which I was assured was \"not a mistake\". And it wasn't. I barely looked up my from my plate as I feasted my eyes on the glorious, pillowy ravioli on my plate. They were seasoned with ginger and nutmeg, tossed in parmesan cream sauce with grilled corn, wilted spinach and mushrooms. The mushrooms were perfectly sauteed, the spinach was wilted just right and the corn was fresh and added the exact amount of crunch that the dish needed. The portion wasn't skimpy either - at some restaurants when you order jumbo ravioli you get 3-4 pieces, but this was more than double the size. Good value for the money.\n\nI was more than tempted by the dessert board (tartufo, ice cream, tiramisu, Grand Marnier cheesecake or crème caramel, Belgian chocolate mousse, apple crumble) but unfortunately dinner left me positively STUFFED. After seeing that Epicure is now open until 1 or 2am every night I know where I'll be heading for late night dessert!","date":"2009-05-20 03:22:43"}

The sauce was tasty but the stuffing overpowered the mushrooms so it ended up tasting like sharp cheese and sauce. The penne san remo is supposed to contain artichoke but we only found two chunks of artichoke out of a container with enough food to feed 3 people. So that was disappointing. The sauce was also really bland and the chicken was overcooked\/rubbery. The stuffed shells were ok, no major issues, they just weren't worth the price.

Only friends and family were invited. We felt very special- either to be considered part of the Spicy Pickle family, or maybe because we made such ridiculous fools of ourselves at the window that they thought we might be \"special\" in the other meaning. Perhaps.\nEither way, free lunch.\n\nIt's not as though I could give a stinky review to anything given to me for free- I might feel bad- but this was just what the doctor ordered. \n\nNot for the weak at heart.\n\nIt's not just a clever name. Their pickles are actually spicy. They seems to be lightly dusted with some kind of chile powder. A nice kick follows a good bite.\n\nI ordered the Dilly something or other. It was half a sandwich (sub or panini) with a bowl of soup. I chose the Corn and Green Chile Bisque with the Sausalito Bandito panini. Delish! It also passed my spicy- enough- for- me- test. Yes, I needed multiple napkins for my nose.\nI could have taken a little more spice, so next time I might ask them to kick it up a notch, but it was a refreshing foray back to my traveling days when I tried to convince a chef in India that, no, I am actually not white. I just have REALLY light skin. Never worked.\n\nAl had the Aztec pizzeti. Coming from NY, I am particular about pizza. This looked like it fit the bill. Very think and crispy crust. A little too much cheese for my taste, but most people out here like it like that. She loved it, along with her bowl of loaded potato soup.\n\nMickey had the Gobbler with a side salad. When she bit into the panini she made a face that I think should remain in the bedroom. Enough said.\n\nBryan had the salad and enjoyed it immensely. It didn't look like much, but I might have to return when they open tomorrow and try it out for myself. The croutons did look very appetizing.\n\nOne of the attentive staff members made the rounds with a tray of mini chocolate chip cookies. Fantastic.

It was served over a bed of greens with a lemon olive oil dressing.\nToday I had the med sub. It was ok- nothing out of the ballpark. I got it with the spoinach salad, which was also delish. \n\nDown to 4.5, but alas no halfs...\n\nStick with the paninis and the salads. Maybe the soups too.

I got here at 3:12, sat at the bar by the tv's and then proceeded to wait for a hello or a welcome that didn't happen until finally about two minutes later. I ask about the happy hour to which the woman working responded they don't have a happy hour since they are running specials. I'm a little sad about the happy hour thing being scratched off but I have had The Otheroom to go before and was pleased with the food so I decided to look at the menu and order something good. I then wait about ten minutes before being approached and the whole time I was sitting there was a guy making drinks and nothing else. How can they have only one bartender? It's slow but it's also Memorial Day weekend and you should have enough people working. I understand people want to split your tab and whatever else but there was a third guy who could have handled whatever problem they had at the register. Anyways back to when the woman came to me she apologized for the wait which I didn't care for at that point and proceeded to order my food. Overall the experience I was expecting wasn't a good one. The food was great and a bar with great food but when the service isn't up to par it deserves a low rating. I work in high end retail and know me and many of my co workers and friends around the mall would like to be treated just like any other customer and be given a great service when we go to eat for our lunches. We work in the service industry and will treat our local clients with the same service we do our tourists. Since this wasn't the case I'll be sharing my experience with the rest of my co workers and friends who work around the mall.","date":"2018-05-28 22:55:31"}

My co-workers and I went here on. Saturday to celebrate a postpartum baby shower. I showed up late so didn't end up ordering food but i tried my friend's food.\n\nThe Nachos were delicious!

Huge portion too! \n\nThe drinks were so affordable! Hooch hour starts after 10pm so all shots were 2$ each and 5$ bar rails! I like the fact that the end of the restaurant turns into a dance floor after maybe 11pm if memory serves me right and they played awesome music the night I was there. \n\nThe best thing about this place, in my opinion, is that there's a mini bar attached to the dance floor with the main bar being so close and is the centre of the restaurant.

We bought an air-conditioner from them in 2014 and one just last summer in 2015.  We've had nothing but problems since the very first day we had it installed.  Not only that, but the guy who comes out is completely rude and his office seems to back him up.  This is a unit which holds 5-tons of Puron so it is pretty big and it's not cheap.  We spent $5000 on the unit and it is still under warranty.  It's a good thing, too, because these people have had to replace it once and now it's compressor just blew yesterday morning.  It had been making horrible noises and shutting down and about a week ago, they came out and replaced the thermostat and the air seemed to work, but it was making an even more horrible noise than before and then 2 nights ago it stopped working altogether again.  So, it just so happens that my roommate was going to call them yesterday, anyway, to come out and fix it AGAIN.  However, before he did, all of a sudden, I heard the loudest BOOM!  I mean, it was like a bomb going off and literally was louder than a shotgun being fired close by.  Then, it had this awful constant noise - like I've never heard before and vapor was coming out of the hose by the valve and there was a funny smell and I didn't know what was going on and I panicked because I wasn't sure if it was smoke or Puron or what so I ran into the house, turned off all of the units, made sure all of our cats were okay and ran back outside real quick with fire-extinguishers just in case it was smoke.  My roommate called them and they said they'd be there within the hour.  Two hours later, a little after noon, the guy shows up and says it's the compressor that totally blew and he'd have to order another one and that they were going to charge $1200 for labor for the 5-hour job it was going to take to do it.  The compressor, itself, is still under warranty.  He tried to say that the problem was our faulty electrical and that it was on our end, therefore, they were not at all to blame for this.  Also, he said this was a completely different issue than the thermostat, which he claimed was a good call and that he did fix that problem correctly.  So, we hired an electrician (one who is extremely reputable) to come out and assess the situation because if it was our end, we knew we needed to not only get it fixed immediately for safety reasons, but I may have owed the guy an apology for insinuating this could have been their fault to begin with.  The electrician came and his findings were that #1, the units were too close to one another to begin with and that after checking the voltages, etc. with his do-hicky (LOL), his findings showed there was not one problem with our electricity, no surges or imbalanced distributions of power, no breaker problems, etc. on our end and he even called his friend who owns another air-conditioning company and his friend told him that had it been on our end it would have not only showed up in his readings, but it would have had to be a surge large enough to, at the very least, surge other electronic items in our home and that really...  it would more realistically be an outage-type surge where other neighbors would also have been affected.  Not only that, but both agreed that there's no way that it should be a 5-hour job to replace a compressor and that the money they were telling us they were going to charge was outlandish.  This electrician made a point of including some of this on the invoice and gave us the contact information of his friend in case we needed additional assistance with this matter.  Thank God for him and for Yelp and all the Yelpers out there who recommended him. :)  \n\nI'm doing this review in the hope of saving anyone out there who may be considering hiring these people for ANY reason a lot of time, headache and money.","date":"2016-08-03 23:37:42"}

I gotta say the flavours of Georgian cuisine is quite unique. These dishes seemed to be made to order because it took quite some time to receive. It may have been more than half an hour.\nMy favorite would be the hachapuri. It makes me think of having pizza but the cheese is distinctly salty and they roll up the boat edges with cheese so the crust is a delight to eat. I wish there were 2 eggs. It definitely balanced the saltiness of the cheese (feta?). It seemed like there were 2 layers of cheese: the crusty top and a layer of soft chese below.\nThe khinkali reminds me of Chinese dumplings but the flavours are truly very different from what I'm used to. It was creamy and dark. Each serving contained 3 dumplings  which doesn't seem like a lot but it really is like its own meal. It definitely needed something to cut the heaviness.\nWhile waiting for the food, we got complimentary appetizers: bread, pickled cabbage and an array of sauces (tomato, Georgian, spicy). The sauces and the pickled cabbage all have tastes I am not familiar with. I ate it all because the food was taking so long to come. The pickled cabbage I did not like so much.\nAll in all, the service was good, the food was filling and I was satisfied.","date":"2016-01-17 05:47:00"}

We went on a bike ride on the first beautiful day of the year and ended up visiting a friend in Verdun. We already know the other Comptoir 21 locations at the Latine Quarter and the Mile-End - but I like this one best. We sat outside (for the first time this year!) and really relished the last light of the day. The waitress was nice and friendly, although she was a little swamped. Once she took our order, the food came pretty fast. While we all had beer, I was actually the only one having fish and chips. My girlfriend had the veggie poutine (they have vegetarian gravy that is not bad) and our friend had a cheeseburger with fries and salad. We all enjoyed our food and I was pleasantly surprised by how calm this street is (compared to busy main streets like saint Denis or Mont-Royal where it's not as nice to sit out in the street). I was also glad for the opportunity to sit outside because sitting inside on the bar makes it harder to have a conversation when more than two people are involved, plus there is a lot of oil in the air near the kitchen.  We went to pay inside and discovered they only accept debit and cash :( but overall this is a good place to have a good time!","date":"2016-05-07 02:11:26"}

How can that be? The Lotus Garden has been around for 60 years and there's no question as to why. The food is fantastic and the staff is very friendly and accomodating.\n\nMy meal always starts out with an egg roll. These are no ordinary egg rolls...they're not tiny, and aren't considered one of those side items tossed in as an afterthought as at most Chinese restaurants. No - these egg rolls could be a meal! Filled with baby shrimp, cabbage, and carrots, the filling is tender with a bit of a crunch. The wrapper isn't your typical thin, fried, \"papery skin\". The wrapper is a bit more substantial because of the size of the egg roll..yet it's crisp on the outside and a little chewy on the inside. The best egg rolls I've ever eaten.\n\nI also like to order the fried pork dumplings. They're pretty basic as pork dumplings go, but they have a great flavor and the dipping sauce is very good. I'm pretty picky about my dumpling sauce. I don't like it too salty or too sweet. This is just perfect with a touch of heat.\n\nMy main course staple is the chicken with garlic sauce. This is noted on the menu as a spicy item. The Thai red pepper flakes give it the right amount of heat without overpowering the garlic brown sauce. It's a simple dish with slivers of white meat chicken, slivered water chestnuts, and a few mushrooms tossed in for good measure. This dish is so flavorful that you don't need anything else. I love the chicken paired with the crunch of the water chestnuts. They both take on the flavor of the sauce quite well. \n\nOther great dishes are the chicken lo mein, General Tso's Chicken, and chicken with broccoli.\n\nPlus the atmosphere is welcoming and cozy. No need for takeout!","date":"2009-05-19 17:41:51"}

Luckily, we ran into friends who assured us that we could seat ourselves.\nAfter waiting at our table for some 15 minutes, we used a bit of self-help, and accosted a waitress to ask for some menus.  After another 5-7 minutes another waitress finally showed up with menus and silverware. She did not offer water, or to bring us a drink of any sort - just plopped the menus down and disappeared.\nQuite some time later, our waitress arrived, apologetically, and took our order.  We ordered an appetizer (cheese fries), and three meals: 1 burger (would have been on wheat bread but despite the menu, they had none), one 1\/2 ribeye (which the menu says was supposed to be thick, but which was certainly not), that should have come with some interesting sounding twice baked potato casserole, and one individual pizza.  My daughter ordered a diet, I ordered water, and my husband ordered a beer.\nThe water and diet only took about 7 minutes to arrive.\nThe appetizer might have arrived after another 10, but the food runner carrying the plate of cheese fries tried to deliver them to another table. Having learned he had the wrong table, the lad just took them back to the kitchen.\nEventually, the cheese fries arrived.  They weren't as hot as one would like, and for the price, there should have been a LOT more cheese.  The fries were no better than I could make using frozen crinkle fries from the grocery.\nWithin 3 minutes of the appetizer's tardy arrival, some of our food arrived.\nThe burger (but not the beer), and my steak with vegetable, but no potato casserole, and no pizza.\nThe waitress arrived, and asked if everything was there, we told her \"no\", and pointed out that we were missing the beer, the potatoes and the pizza.  Ten minutes later the beer arrived.\nMy husband then went up to the window where the pizza would have been put up for a food runner -- no pizza had been ordered.\nSo. \nThe steak was fatty, but moderately tasty, if only tepid.  The broccoli was cold, the burger was not as good as you can get at, say Hardee's (despite costing twice as much). \nWe never did get the pizza.  Or the potatoes.  \nI DID offer to come in as a consulting manager to help them teach the staff how to actually wait tables......","date":"2013-12-07 02:26:13"}

I concur with the commenter who noted that the parking situation is difficult.  However, being close to I-15 and Spring Mountain is a huge advantage for me, and it is open 24 hours.\n\nA relatively new member of the staff is Tony, who recently left Saigon 8.  The guy is terrific, and I've seen him iron out the bumps when language is a problem.  He's the reason I came to this restaurant in the first place.\n\nI've had pho twice and vermicelli with grilled pork, spicy (#68) once.  The pho broth was pretty good (not quite Saigon 8, but not bad), and the meat, etc., was also good.  The #68 was the best thing I've had there, and it is served in a bowl rather than a plate, which I think helped.  The restaurant was jam packed (Friday, about 1:30 p.m.), but service went smoothly.  By the time I was finished, I would say about two thirds of the crowd had left after eating.\n\nAt the table, There was hoisin sauce and Sriracha hot sauce, plus fish sauce and soy sauce.  There was also a jar of a pepper sauce that looked like a Szechuan sauce, but didn't have the heat.  There were plain wooden chop sticks, which I like, spoons, and small saucers, which I use to mix a dip.  I've mentioned in my Jenny Pho review that this is the way I prefer it, instead of bringing stuff out with the pho, and using lacquered chop sticks.\n\nOne thing you should know is that there is a sign that says cash only.  That changed a couple of months ago.  They allow major credit cards (Visa, MC), but they left the sign up.\n\nI like the restaurant for the quality of the food, which is pretty good, location, near I-15, and the fact that Tony now works here, and he's terrific.\n\nSomething I should have said earlier:  Pho Little Saigon makes its own Vietnamese sandwiches.  I brought some home, and they're very good.  Pho Saigon 8 doesn't  make its own, though there's a shop that makes them out the rear of their parking lot.","date":"2014-11-30 01:24:25"}

Than Joes Farm Grill is the place for you. Even if you have simple tastes Joes Farm Grill will have something to suit your needs.  It has beautiful decoration, great food and affordable prices, so why not pay a visit. \nJoes Farm Grill has a long historical background, with a house originally built in 1966 by the Johnston family. In later years it was decided to turn the farm into a restaurant with its food being home grown or locally brought in. The house development around the farm is Agritopia, and was dedicated to permanent urban farming. In fact if you live in the development surrounding the restaurant you can rent a garden lot to grow vegetables.  All of their products are certified USDA organic, and their focus is common food done uncommonly. They feel fresh food taste better and are better for you so why not share all that with the customers. They take the foods taste to a new level with all of the recipes and ingredients. \nJoes Farm Grill is delicious, unique and a fun experience. I feel most restaurants are chains and don't have the history behind them like Joes does, and because of this it makes the experience much more special. Knowing your food is organic makes it taste ten times better, and knowing you don't have to spend a fortune for organic makes me want to go again. It's really stands out among most and everyone in the chandler area needs to stop by and visit. \n First walking up to the twelve acre masterpiece is like going through a farm, with orange trees covering the path and large oaks surrounding it which gives a beautiful green glow of a garden.  It smells fresh and gives you an earthy vive. They are enormous and full of green vegetables that look extremely appetizing. They are covering most of the land and you can walk through them and see your food growing.  The building is white with large windows showing the back and the front equally, and the inside has simple decorations with light blue and green accents not to overpower the beauty of the vegetation growing outside. It holds no more than a hundred people and is rather spacious seating. The entire restaurant is very simple with a 60s feel mixed with a futuristic time. I ordered the jumbo breaded shrimp with fries, French toast banana peanut butter sandwich and the barbeque chicken pizza. I went with my sister because the portions are rather large and I could not have eaten it by myself. This was my first time visiting the restaurant and my sisters second. Everything so far was very pleasant and the employees were very nice. No more than ten minutes later our food was ready and it looked and smelt great. We sat down and I tried each dish, starting with the shrimp which were very large. The shrimp was crunchy and juicy and was simple and not overpowering. I thought it tasted very good and wasn't too rich which is a problem I normally find when ordering shrimp. Then I tried the French toast peanut butter sandwiches that surprisingly had strawberry's in it too. This was one of the best tasting things I have ever had! It was a house specialty and lives up to its name. It tasted like a gourmet peanut butter sandwich and was so flavorful and sweet. I had to order another one. Then I tried the barbeque pizza, I liked it but it wasn't my favorite. It was thin crust and slightly burnt, but it did taste good with the cheese and chicken combination. It just tasted like there was too many ingredients on the pizza that overpowered it. The prices weren't that bad either, the shrimp was the most expensive at 14.99 when I go again I probably won't order this again, just because it wasn't a to die for dish.  The peanut butter sandwiches were 10.99 and I crave these every day it was amazing! Than last the pizza was 12.99, my sister liked it more than I did so it depends on your taste but I probably will try something else. \nThe most important part though is the food, and not to leave you hanging was no matter what spectacular. Fresh fries galore. The most appealing part to me was the decorations and the gardens surrounding the place. I think the set up as if you're in a food court is a really interesting concept; you have to throw away your own food on trays, and clean up after yourself. I didn't expect that and I think it's a smart move on the restaurants part.  The calm and relaxing atmosphere, and no rush pace is really nice. \nI enjoyed Joes Farm Grill and I plan on visiting again. I think the organic concept and urban farming is a really nice thing to hear about in today's society. I feel better knowing I'm eating organic, and knowing there are still places that are going strong with the idea of organic. I hope the success of this restaurant shows others they can do the same. This restaurant meets all my needs as a customer, clean, green and tasty what more could you want.","date":"2012-06-25 23:41:20"}

Cue Club is large inside and out. Like how can they use this much space? The bartender gave us the lowdown as soon as we walked in: the building is divided into smoking and non smoking and each have either quarter tables or pay by the hour tables. Apparently you can only do pay by the hour if you're a pro. We chose the non smoking side and there were 2-3 other tables being used at the time. The jukebox was surprisingly really good until someone chose to play their own tunes. We did end up smelling like cigarette smoke afterwards. Not sure if this is from hanging out in the smoking area initially or if it's so overpowering that it gets into the non smoking area. They also have shuffleboard and a few carnival style games like skee ball. Knowing that most any billiards hall in Vegas is going to be equally smoky I think I'd rather come here and know your chances of getting a table are pretty good and they're at least attempting to offer a non smoking option.","date":"2018-10-04 17:47:38"}

However, it paled in comparison to many of the 2-starred venues.  The prices are obscene first of all - about double what I've grown accustomed to paying for a  similar experience (even the champagne).  Not to mention, the bites and bubbles menu at Guy Savoy we had tackled two nights prior was MUCH more affordable and more enjoyable.\n\nOur standard 5 course menu began with what was really  an oversized amuse bouche, a chopped apple with spices served in a glass wrapped with pictures of apples.  Good but not worthy of being called an appetizer.  The next dish was cold, shaved foie gras and thin slices of black truffles arranged in a salad.  The truffle slices were old or improperly stored and had absolutely no flavor.  I absolutely love truffles and should have sent it back; huge disappointment.  The foie gras was excellent however.  \n\nThe main courses were a boring fish cooked in a unneccesarily huge iron pot and some wagyu steak.  The quality of the steak was amazing, much like the one time I've had authentic prime wagyu before where I was charged far less for the pleasure. \n\n The one saving grace of the meal was dessert..  The presentation of a shiny, glittery ball that melted upon contact with a warm sauce was spectacular.  The dessert trolley offered a wide selection of expertly prepared mignardises.  The free take-home box of chocolates was a nice touch.    Service was great but not exceptional and the tables were packed too closely.  \n\nOverall, Robuchon is hardly deserving of 3 michelin stars based on our one experience, though your mileage may vary .  I feel that it was all style over substance and that may be fine for fashion bu not for food.  At half the price, I'd have been more forgiving (3-4 stars), but I felt cheated and given the many other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I don't feel there's any reason to visit Robuchon.  And I say this having gone in with a very positive attitutide after dining at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Paris, which was exceptional all around.  If you do go to Robuchon, my one piece of advice is to go a la cart, which I didn't realize was an option and seemed almost reasonable.","date":"2009-10-13 15:01:50"}

I have received sports massages, Swedish and deep tissue. I consider La Vida to be a very good facility and Angel to be a very competent therapist. For more than 6 months I have gone once every 3-4 weeks.\n\nI work out regularly and consider a massage a great way to heal sore muscles and low back pain from sitting at a desk all day. After my old therapist moved to Florida, I began the annoying process of trying new ones. Some have trouble dialing up or down the pressure. Some can't get the low back pain out like others. Some reek of cigarette smoke. Some are lazy, using one hand at a time instead of two.\n\nThen I found Angel, who is quite competent. If you wanna chat, she'll chat. If you want quiet relaxation, she'll put you at ease. If you say \"I hurt here\", she will solve it. I consider one of Angel's attributes to be the fact she can dial up or down pressure just BARELY, and maintain that. She can find where it hurts and, due to her through knowledge of fascia and layers of tissue, massage the pain away. After repeat sessions, she understands I need more pressure on the right side of my spine than my left. Angel's ability to meet her clients needs combined with her through knowledge of muscle and fascia along with the ability to maintain consistent pressure make her an extremely competent therapist.\n\nIf Angel is busy or sick, Ivan is a fantastic alternative. He's an A in my book, with Angel an A+. Edit: Forgot to mention, Ivan's strengths are deep tissue and neck work. If your neck specifically is killing you or you need real deep tissue, Ivan is your man.\n\nLa Vida is an upper middle \/ yuppie chain massage location with ample parking. I feel strongly that these are superior to middle brow chain massage places (such as Massage Envy) and superior to upscale spas (such as Sewickly or Seven Springs or Esspa). Simply put, La Vida has lots of returning clients and as such, a steady stream of business and competent and calm massage therapists with little turnover.","date":"2014-02-05 20:28:23"}

Thus, we actually PREFER a hotel with no casino in it. I got a Travelzoo rate several months ago for $109\/nt for a King Suite with a view.\n\nWhen we arrived, check-in was VERY efficient and speedy. Our room was on the 55th floor and we had a view straight down the Strip. The room was spacious and had a well-equipped kitchenette (including Sub Zero mini fridge, Bosch microwave and Cuisinart toaster and blender). The bathroom had a huge marble shower and separate Jacuzzi bathtub, double marble sinks and a flatscreen TV INSIDE of the mirror! The furnishings are very clean and modern and the room felt luxurious.\n\nThe best part of the entire room was the bed! It was easily the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in -- IN MY LIFE! The front desk told me they are made by Stearns & Foster specially for Mr. Trump, but that he thinks something similar is available through the company. The sheets were high TC and the pillows and comforter were lofty and plump. The hotel also offers a 4 p.m. late checkout for no additional charge, which was perfect since we were out until 4 a.m. the night before.\n\nMy complaints are extremely minor: no call-down service for the valet (but the wait was usually only about 10 minutes), no free WiFi ($12\/day is a little steep and I felt it should have been included), no additional toiletries like mouthwash or toothpaste and the shampoo\/conditioner wasn't very high quality. Boyfriend also thought there should be some sort of rubber mat for the shower, since it was all marble and was very slippery once wet. My only other comment is that the lobby is a little bit gauche (but, it's Vegas...what lobby isn't?!).\n\nAll in all, I thought this was a FANTASTIC value and, as I said, the best bed I've experienced in my life. I will definitely be back.\n\np.s. in response to those who say it's \"off the Strip,\" it's not.

For the most part the wait staff was okay but could definitely improve but what I found awful were the lifeguards.   The first day we were at the pool three lifeguards just talked amongst themselves and bottle flipped to keep themselves busy. Yes, bottle flipped - my 8 year kids favorite game.  There was even a point where a young child in the pool went face down in the water and the adult with them didn't notice and guess what? Neither did the lifeguards.   No kidding someone is going to die on their watch if they continue like this.  The second day here it was two lifeguards having a bromance looking at each other the whole time instead of at the pool.  I get that it's not that busy but it's a job that has some dangerous consequences if you aren't doing your job even for a moment.  Instead they were passing a life float between them for fun, talking about picking girls up at the bar to the point my husband had to leave becauae he didn't want to here their childish talk anymore.   \n\nOtherwise a fantastic stay.

Not very  appetizing.  They might want to rethink putting the paper in their bowls.  Anyway, wouldn't pay $8 for this again, and likely won't visit them again either.","date":"2013-02-21 20:29:15"}

They have their entire line-up of current beers to choose from and an excellent little store that you can purchase bombers and interesting things like Trois Pistoles Mustard, Blance De Chambly Orange Marmalade, and Trois Pistoles Blackberry Jam (we purchased all three of these and they are all delicious)!\n\nWe hit the restaurant at a weird time (around 4pm) on this trip and they had a limited menu.  We did a meat and cheese plate to go along with a Sampler (3 ounces of Blanche De Chambly, Ephemere [Seasonal], Blonde De Chambly, Noire De Chambly, La Fin Du Monde, and Trois Pistoles) and Seigneuriale for me and an Ephemere Cerise (Cherry) for my wife.  A minor setback was that four of the six beers in my sampler came out of the bottle instead of the tap, so only two of them had that super-fresh taste, but it was still good nonetheless.  I would recommend finding out what is on draft and sticking with those, though, because those beers will rank among the best beers you will ever have in your life.\n\nRestaurant atmosphere was beautiful.  When we went during the summer, it felt like a lovely cottage house on the lake.  When it was cold in October, it felt like a rustic ski lodge just getting ready for the snow.

Even if you're heading to Quebec City, it's not difficult to get to, just a long trip after you leave.

Please note that we were able to purchase Unibroue shirts on our first trip through but we heard a rumor that no more clothes were being produced.  I hope they change their mind on that one!

I love everyone I interacted with thus far at Gateway! I have two dogs - one loves everyone (so this was easy for him) and the other is ... a little more hesitant. When I came in, the lobby seemed pretty busy (they were getting low on seating, but not out) and I took a number. I was seen less than 30 minutes later, and never felt like my wait was too long.\n\nWhen I was taken back, there are tables set up, where the vets and vet techs come talk with you and help your pet. You're not in a separate room (like my old vet). This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think for one of my dogs it was better because while he got blood drawn and a vaccine, he was too distracted to care - there was (what looked like a) lab\/pit mix across the room who may have at one point looked at him! How interesting! and that golden over there! What's that smell behind me?\n\nEveryone that works there is friendly, and they work quickly. Since they work rather quickly, don't expect to sit down and have a long conversation. They get to the point, and then send you on your way because there are twenty more dogs to be seen. I never felt rushed though.\n\nIf you own pets, you know that they can be expensive. Even small expenses add up quickly. I ended up at Gateway because I priced out my annual vet trip at my old vet and cringed. A lot. I called around and checked out a few other places. I felt like Goldilocks. One vet was a little cheaper, but the staff seemed to hate their jobs and maybe me. Another vet was more expensive but seemed nice. Gateway? Gateway was just right. Gateway didn't offer me any discount, yet I felt like I got two for the price of one (I paid what I would have for just one dog at my old place). My dogs got their vaccines for the next year plus(heartworm and rabies), as well as kennel cough, and one of my dogs got microchipped. Previously I was told that the kennel cough vaccine is given every other year as a shot, and every other nasal - but Gateway had oral. That was so much easier on both of my dogs! One of my dogs is a pug, so the nasal was unpleasant for him and I (on the plus side, last year I got the vaccine as well - since he sprayed it all over me). \n\nBoth of my dogs seemed well cared for while I was there, and got plenty of love. The microchipped dog seemed neutral (and wouldn't take any treats from the vet tech after she took him to get microchipped), but he pug LOVED it. I practically had to drag him out of there. Being so incredibly busy, you'd expect Gateway to be a circus, but it was run pretty smoothly. I hope I won't be back until next year, but I know that regardless they'll take excellent care of us.","date":"2013-05-08 05:19:03"}

And still have not been able to afford to fix all of the damage done in the accident that they overlooked due to quick in and out. I had to buy a new battery 3 days later when my car wouldn't start. Whatever mechanic worked on my car forgot to plug in the power cord to my new radiator cooling fan and my car overheated and had to spend money to get a diagnosis why it was overheating and was a simple wire not plugged in. So also proof it was never even tested to see if the new fan worked . This was a front end collision and then I had and still have a loud clicking sound coming from my front wheel where the rim wasn't replaced.  When I took it elsewhere for inspection soon after due to no reply from multiple messages left for the owner gone without a reply? Rather than bother with them after speaking with an ex-employee, I realized I was screwed.  So then I had a broken tie rod not noticed or added to my estimate and anyone knows you need an alignment when you replace a tie rod so another 300 bucks total. \n    But still have the clicking noise or loud tapping and my friend said it's either The CV joint or a bent control arm. But couldn't tell without it on a lift . So now will end up spending a fortune to finally get my car back to perfect operating condition like it was before one of their tow truck drivers just happened to be standing there in downtown Pittsburgh during rush hour with a walkie.  Waiting to prey on me. But I still haven't gotten to the most corrupt part.  Geico paid them from my estimate to recharge my A.C. since it was obvious that it was routine when my radiator, cooling fan, and coolant tank were all destroyed. But guess what happened when I went to actually USE my A.C. a couple months later once winter broke? Hot air. So I took it to Ryan's Auto\/Goodyear in Moon. Twp., and explained everything to them. They said well I can't imagine they would have not recharged your system with refrigerant.  So I paid for a diagnosis and dye ran thru the system and nice of them to only charge me 75 bucks and guess what? Cold air!!! NO LEAKS! SO THEY NEVER EVEN RECHARGED MY A.C. Crooks! And guess what else ? I AM AN UBER DRIVER FOR 2PLUS YEARS NOW AND UBER HAS THEIR TEST TRACK BLOCKS AWAY FROM THIS SHOP IN HAZELWOOD JUST BEHIND THE RAILROAD TRACKS! I have driven Uber employees there too many times to count and as well as them? I tell ALL of my riders to NEVER take their car here no matter what.","date":"2017-06-27 23:15:12"}

FIrst off the parking is very strange you have to park off to the side and walk past an empty boarded up building to get to the front door.  The decor is more rock diner than mexican restaurant, but nice enough.  On a weekday at 12:00 they were completely empty and it's a huge restaurant so that's a little bit of a concern right off the bat.  I had the cheese enchiladas which were ok, not anything special and kinda plain.  The Corn pudding for a side was something you never see and was the best thing on my plate.  The Anaheim Chili stuffed with sweet potato would be better if they removed the skin. It was pretty inedible the way it was served and very messy to scrape the pepper and potato off the skin to eat it.  I will give them props for trying something different, but poor execution at any rate.\n\nThe high point was our great server. She was very friendly and really nice.

This place is really nice and you feel a little bit underdressed if you aren't in your Sunday best. \n\nI made reservations ahead of time but the place didn't looked too packed for a Saturday night. We had a nice table an attentive waiter. We got our drinks pretty quickly and the martinis were strong.  There was some live music being heard from the lounge area near the bar area which had a nice touch to it. \n\nI still went with the meat selection even though this was the Ocean Club. My boyfriend and I both had petite which is served on a searing hot plate. The meat continues to cook on the plate and just easily cuts like butter. The steak just melts in your mouth as the seasoning of the meat and light butter from the plate meet in your mouth, I call it Meaty Symphonic Harmony. \n\nWe also ordered the sweet potato fries as a side. This is no mere small side dish but a mound of fries is delivered. Each fry is seasoned with an almost tempura like batter on the outside that leaves you craving more and more. I was stuffed after the filet and the fries and the yummy bread basket they bring you (with warm pretzel bread and other goodies). \n\nDessert is something that just can't be missed and I suggest the sinful delight of the signature Warm Butter Cake and whipped cream. The butter cake is rich and heavy with deliciousness and the whipped cream is no ordinary whipped cream. It almost has the consistency of ice cream as it hits your palate. \nThis is my treat for the year, it is expensive so be warned but it is also a high class meal.

My friend had the jambalaya, which looked deliciously comforting, but she reported the chicken was dry and overcooked and the shrimp was underseasoned. The bite I tasted was too hot (spice-wise, not temp) for me. \n\nThe decor was comforting in a British pub style.

Hey, free apple.  \n\nNot everything they have is permanent.  Sometimes something new will be there, and the next week it will be gone, but in a way, I like that about it.  You go in there, and they have these Indian pickles made from wild cucumbers.  Next week, in its place, will be garlic pickles or something else awesome.\n\nFor what the place is, it's marvelous.  It's a little place and about as un-ghetto as it gets.

Foodwise, it was good but I'd expect that from a place like this.  I ordered one of their Mixup lunches which gives you a salad option, a protein and a side.  I ordered the mixed green salad, the porcini mushroom and pepper encrusted strip and an order of carmelized cauliflower as a side.\n\nThe strip was amazing.  It came sliced over a layer of steak sauce.  It was cooked perfectly.  The salad was ok....mixed greens with tomatoes, blue cheese and a dressing that I still do not recognize.  The cauliflower came in a mound.  Honestly, this had to be 1\/2 to 2\/3 of the head of cauliflower.  It was seasoned with capers and other herbs.  While the taste was good, the quantity was entirely too much and I could only eat half.\n\nThe decor of the place is as you would expect with a lot of medium to dark wood but it just didn't do anything for me.  Same with the service. While they were all friendly, our water just didn't go beyond what he was expect to do.   \n\nSorry, Sullivans but I can get better service at Longhorn and frankly I think their food is better also.

My wife and I enjoy eating at this place but realize that it is small, and often busy. Another option is take-out which we often opt for, because we live close, and can still enjoy the food at home. That hasn't been an option the last two attempts that I have made to order take-out because the line was busy. The first time it happened, I had to go to the restaurant, order the food, and wait 45 minutes to get the food. \nI tried again on Friday to order food, and again the line was busy. After many call attempts, my wife and I decided to see if we could get a table. When I got there I was told that there was a 35 minute wait for a table. I went into the bar to see if there were any tables available. There was one available, however a woman who was waiting for a table in the main dining room was occupying it. We decided to eat elsewhere. \n\nIf there aren't ever any tables available, and I can't get through to order take-out, I can't see any reason to attempt to order from here again.","date":"2017-04-30 05:42:02"}

However, when the bartender at the awesome strip mall wine bar told me about this place you could get buggalo of food for less than a five spot, I was sold.  \n\nCook Out is an anomaly among fast food places in that its menu has everything you could ever want, or at least everything I could ever want (sans corn nuggets).  Cook Out offers the boring old hamburger thing but don't let that distract you- opt for the BBQ.  For less than $5, you get your own picnic.  \n\nMy plate had a hockey puck sized portion of pulled pork, a couple fingers of hush puppies, fries, and slaw. The chronic pulled pork was super moist considering it was 1 AM, and came topped with Texas Pete's.  Although it was delicious, isn't Carolina BBQ supposed to be heavy on the sauce?  The hush puppies were okay (more breading than bread), and the fries forgettable.  When it comes to cole slaw, I am a snob but Cook Out's slaw was surprisingly good; it was house made and very dry, but I mean that in a good way.   It's also worth mentioning that you can get a corn dog as a side.  I don't know why, but as a Southern gentleman, I agree with and salute that.  \n\nHow Cook Out really let me get my jollies was the drink menu.  Cheerwine- my god, if I ever make a lot of money I'm putting a fountain of that crack drank in my house.  If you're from out of town, drink up because that stuff can only be found in North Carolina.  They also have about 40 different kinds of milkshakes available, including seasonal ones.  The winter shake is eggnog but apparently they only have that one in December.  The fact that they have a watermelon shake in the summer blows my mind.  Be warned though, the shakes are thick like a Petey Pablo video girl- you'll need a spoon, or at least a boba tea straw.  \n\nAs I said, the idea of a fast food BBQ joint just doesn't do it for me, but Cook Out pulls together the concept beautifully.  It's like if Jesus and Allah got along and then made a baby.  A beautiful mixed baby named Cook Out.","date":"2008-12-03 04:07:28"}

A few months ago, I began having an issue with the ice maker. The ice smelled bad and tasted worse. The water still tastes amazing and is odorless. I replaced the filter and thoroughly cleaned the fridge, emptied and cleaned the ice bin several times to no avail. Chemical type smell, similar to freezer burn, but different. Emptied the entire fridge (as that is where the ice maker is located), nothing helped. Looking at Google, I discovered this is a common problem. I contacted Lowe's as I have a 5 year warranty, and they sent Buy-Rite.\n\nTech showed up and used his laser thermometer in the fridge, drink drawer, and freezer. I explained that the issue was the way the ice was tasting\/smelling, and not with the temperature. And also that it was a common problem reported online in reviews, etc. The tech told me there was no solution, but that he noticed dog hair under my fridge. \n\nI took 5 hours off work to wait for the tech to come for 5 minutes and tell me there was no solution.

The roll very pretty big and the shrimps tasted fresh. I especially like that it wasn't like most sushi rolls around here that are 90% rice and litte else. Once we were seated I ordered the steak and scallop hibachi.  This was my favorite by far! The steak was perfectly cooked and the scallops were especially tasty.

We ended up having to call the front desk and ask where we were supposed to park the car to unload our bags. She seemed confused by this request and after a few minutes she told us just to leave the car in the service entrance behind the hotel. Weird! What hotel doesn't have some sort of established valet system for their guests arriving in cars. \n\nCheck in was fine and the staff was nice but I knew as I walked in this wasn't going to work out. The lobby was super small. It was cramped with four people waiting at the front desk. We were told we had been upgraded to a junior suite, so I was hopeful the room at least would be nice. The elevator was dark and dingy and barely fit two people with luggage. \n\nAs soon as we got to the room, the few hopes I had left were dashed. The room size was nice but it was just....dingy. The bed was lumpy, everything from the curtains to the dust ruffle were wrinkled and stained. The linoleum was cracked, the burner carpet looked like it had been there for roughly a hundred years.

The price for my alteration was less than any other place I've frequented.   \n\nOn an earlier occasion, a friend and I took a well-worn leather jacket in for a repair estimate.  The tailor, who is obviously extremely talented, polite and personable, was honest about what could be accomplished and what the repairs would cost.  While we didn't use their services then (we threw the jacket out), I really appreciate a business that values honesty over a cash grab.  These guys are great.","date":"2016-05-07 02:16:01"}

While there are numerous \"famous-chef\" restaurants and buffets galore on the strip, sometimes you just need a break from mass produced hotel food.  \n\nPenang Malaysian Cuisine fit the bill perfectly.  Located on Spring Mountain Road on the second floor of a mini mall, Penang is a medium sized, modest looking restaurant on the outskirts of Las Vegas' Chinatown area.   \n\nThe first thing that struck me when we arrived was how empty the restaurant was...where were the people?  Only 1 table was filled, but from the way they were eating, it looked like they were enjoying the food.  \n\nThe menu is extensive and offers a large variety of appetizers, rice dishes, noodle dishes, curries, seafood, beef, pork, chicken, and vegetables.  I loved that in addition to the list of menu items, there are pictures for every dish!  This helped a lot since my husband and I are not all that familiar with Malaysian cuisine.   \n\nWe ordered the roti canai, a stir fry vegetable dish with shrimp paste (similar to chinese spinach, ong choy), a spicy curry chicken, and a rice noodle stir fry.  All of the dishes were delicious.   The roti was light, flaky, and hot.  The accompanying curry dipping sauce was the perfect vehicle for sopping up the yummy sauce.  So flavorful and spicy.  The vegetable stir fry and noodle dishes were also tasty.  The star of the show, however was the curry chicken.  OMG!  I wish I had a second stomach to eat more of that dish.  The curry was spicy and dripping with flavor.  Just thinking of it is making my tummy grumble and mouth water...\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive.  They kept filling our water and wanted to make sure we were happy with our food.  The prices were reasonable and portions just right.  \n\nOverall we were extremely happy with our meal and will definitely be returning!","date":"2011-03-20 04:20:27"}

The place had a Classy Decor, Very Professional Staff and Clientele were mostly Upper Class looking individuals. \n\nStarters:\n\nBread with butter, jam and ketchup?!: Bread was shaped like a branch with leaves.. something like that. It was hard but the inside was soft and tasted fresh. The butter was kinda hard too, the jam was pretty good and the ketchup I guess was for the fries to come? Who eats bread with ketchup?\n\nCheese Danish - Looked like a croissant shaped like a muffin, with a dab of some cream cheese butter on top. This was So Flaky\/Soft and the cream cheese butter lightly spread throughout was perfectly balanced.. This wasn't your ordinary cheese danish (pre-packaged grocery store bought), this thing was Superb!\n\nCroque Madame: Toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce. Served with pommes frites.. Sounded quite fancy for a breakfast dish - In Layman's Terms = Ham & Cheese Sandwich with Egg and Fries! Toast tasted like a really buttered croissant with an airy texture. Ham & Cheese wasn't the oscar mayer ham nor Kraft cheese I use for h&c sandwiches back at home, it was much more gourmealicous! Plus, with the fried egg, more like a sunny side up egg and their white creamy\/frothy sauce, makes an Incredible Sandwich! Fries were served as a generous amount and were plain good. \n\nCorned Beef Hash with eggs and toast: Corned Beef hash came in shallow bowl with a blanket of overeasy eggs practically covering the hash. I scooted over the eggs to try just the flavor of the corned beef. They were little cubed chunks sitting on top of some pretty tasty juice\/sauce. The cubes tasted and had the texture of ham. The juice\/sauce gave it a great beef flavor but not the usual Real and typical corned beef I'm used to having. Nevertheless, it was Good. The toast were thick and had a buttery flavor and reminded me of a Crouton. Like a Toast Bread Shaped Crouton?!..\n\nFancy  Place, Great Service, Delectable Food But Came with a price.. $83.00 for 2 including 11.00 Tip.. Oh, it did include 2 Mimosa's!

This review is for Saryo.\n\nI'm a matcha fiend and have to politely disagree with all the other reviewers praising Saryo's matcha. It really doesn't compare with Tsujiri. Tsujiri has a much longer history of doing matcha and Saryo's matcha is simply not the same grade. High quality matcha is supposed to have a subtle sweetness in addition to a slight bitter taste. Too bitter does not mean it's better. Saryo's matcha soft serve is simply not as pronounced and lacks that subtle sweetness I would expect. The texture is also a bit more runny than I would like. \n\nAlso, their selection is much smaller than Tsujiri and most of the pastry items are a notch worse than Tsujiri. \n\nCustomer service wise, I can't get over one of their servers. It's a guy named Taiki I think. Horrible service. If you want good matcha drinks and desserts, definitely go to Tsujiri instead. Prices are about the same but you get less quality at Saryo.

Whoever the woman was that I was assigned to could not find a vein to get blood. This was important for medical reasons to get done and she was very unprofessional and rude. I recently moved to PA from Ohio, so I didn't know a phlebotomist here can only try three times. I kindly said to her 'can I ask why you can only try three times?' And she gave me a nasty uncaring look and replied quickly 'because I'm not a doctor'. After I left, all I could think was no shit you aren't a doctor, it's not a doctor's job to take blood, it's your job( a phlebotomists' job). I thought it was very unprofessional. I've never dealt with someone in the medical field that didn't truely care or have passion for helping me, especially if I ask a question. I don't remember her name, and if I did I wouldn't put her name out there. I just wish people would stop and remember the reason why they chose that field. Yes, money is great for most of the opportunities, but you really have to care and want to make a difference in order to be successful in the medical field. Even if someone asks a stupid common sense question, just remember there is a reason they are choosing you to ask. If someone asks me anything, I feel honored because they care about my opinion and what it is I have to say. Just saying, sorry for rambling!","date":"2018-05-08 17:15:07"}

So, a change in food was very much needed. My co-workers mentioned this restaurant a while ago. Today, I decided to feed my culinary curiosity and order lunch for my co-worker (aka my lunch homie) and I. Harry's Grill and Tavern, here we come! Here are some of the items that we ordered :\n\nMapleleaf Farms Duck Wings w\/Bourbon BBQ sauce and Jicama Slaw\n\n1) Initially, the chicken looked a little parched. Last night's chicken? Ummm, I hope not. However, the taste was decent. Portion size was good. \n\n2) The Jicama slaw was an excellent take on slaw. Traditional slaw (cabbage) can sometimes become very boring. However, the Jicama put a nice spin on it. The lunch homie, though, with her traditionalist, non-risk taking tongue, let the slaw fall gently from her mouth. You can't please every palate.  \n\nSmall Mixed Green Salad with Raspberry Vinaigrette and Mac - N - Cheese - Lunch Combo\n\n1) Harry's Mac - N - Cheese was the greatest joy that I experienced during this meal! The consistency and texture was great...not too dry and not loose...just creamy goodness in my belly! The levels of cheesiness was outstanding. And the light sprinkling of panko crumbs provided that last bit of contrast and crunch. The Comfort Food gods have bestowed their blessings on this particular dish.\n\n2) Bought the Small Mixed Green salad to eat for dinner. The portion size definitely small, but it's packed with some good stuff. Can't wait to get my greedy hands on it later this evening!\n \nHarry Old Fashioned Burger with a side of Sweet Potato Fries\n\n1) My lunch homie ordered a Harry's Old Fashion Burger with a side order of sweet potato fries. I snagged a few and they were good. I've ordered sweet potato fries at other establishments and I've always needed additional condiments (i.e. Honey Mustard sauce)  to add some taste. However, we both agreed that these fries were great by themselves. The slight sweetness of vanilla gave the side item a little more depth, while the salt reminds you that it's still a fry.\n\nShe was less enthusiastic about her burger, though. I believed she said that she had better times with a BK Whopper. Hey, I'm not a burger connoisseur,  so who am I to judge? The presentation of the burger was well put together. Wasn't sloppy or unappealing. Just your typical pub burger waiting to be consumed.\n\nAll items were moderately priced. My tab totaled to 31.12. Our lunch take out order was timely ( ready in 15 minutes) and accurate. Great location and if you're a non-parallel parker such as myself, they have easy access to the restaurant from the parking garage.  I will definitely return to see what Harry's has to offer for dinner and brunch. I must try the Lobster Mac - N - Cheese!!!","date":"2016-07-14 20:03:15"}

Over all it was good, I'd say the best was the bread, soft and fresh can't ever go wrong with that. Would I return, probably not, if they adjust the prices and have more lunch specials that are worth the travel then I probably say I would come back and try many other subs.

So we took a seat inside only to find 2 groups had left the patio 10 minutes later.  We would have waited for a patio seat if we had the option as it was a lovely night.  \n\nWhen we were greeted by our waiter he told us that we could only order off the summerlicious menu.

My food rating would have been 1 if not for the appetizer.  My boyfriend got the duck buns and said my appetizer was better.  The main course was the maple baby back ribs.  I was looking forward to these all day and was very disappointed.  They were way too spicy and not cooked very well.  Ribs should be falling off the bone if cooked properly - these definitely were not! There was also no plate for the bones or wet naps for us - but that has nothing to do with the food, but more to do with the service.  For dessert I had the brownie ice cream cake and my boyfriend had blue berry pie.  The pie had no taste and was infinitely better than my cake.  The brownie part was so hard that I couldn't cut into it with my spoon.  After two bites (my b\/f had to cut it for me!)

I want to be fair. We will start with the good stuff.\nWe stayed here back in June 2017. We, my husband and I, were going to Las Vegas for combination of Honeymoon and my husbands 40th Birthday. We invited some friends to join us. We ended up with about 20 of us there. We didnt all stay at the Flamingo. Only 6 of us did. Others stayed in time shares and other hotels. We are platinum members so we got to skip the long line, That was great. We chose the Flamingo because it was iconic. We knew it was a bit older and less expensive so we really were prepared for less fancy than other places. We were ok with that. Good thing too since our mini suite was quite run down and not very clean. Housekeeping obviously needs some training. But we didnt really mind. We had the Birthday party at Carlos and Charlies with all 20 of us. It was great and our waiter , Jason, was the best. We rented a cabana at the Go pool which was pretty nice but the mister in the cabana didnt work and just dripped water all over our stuff. Between my Husband and I and the rest of our party we spent many thousands of dollars. We had saved so we could do anything and everything we wanted and we did. It was great. At the point of getting our bags out of the room and heading down to check out I probably would have given them 4 stars. Quite pleased with the experience to this point....\nAnd that was the point where we discovered that the staff at The Flamingo did not want us to have happy memories. At the check out kiosk we discovered a charge of just over a thousand dollars that we didnt understand. We went to the front desk and were told that someone in housekeeping had gone into our room and noticed sleeping bags and enough luggage for about 6 extra people. -First of all, our do not disturb sign was up the entire time so no one was supposed to go in there at all.-  I told her that was a lie and we wouldnt pay it. She went in the back to talk to a manager and came out with out the manager and with no solution. She called housekeeping and was told the supervisor was not available but that they had pictures to prove it. I asked to see the pictures. They never could supply them. We had to leave to catch a plane but didnt pay. We had agreed with the front desk lady that it would be left as pending until the problem was resolved. After weeks of calling and getting no returned phone calls. Total run around. They never supplied us with pictures. It was a horrible experience. We found out we could contact Ceasars Customer Service so we did. They did call us back and said the charge had been removed. No sorry, No admitting they had made a mistake. It was more like just take it off to get us to shut up. So we dropped it because the charge was removed but never made happy. We will stay at Ceasars properties but never at the Flamingo again.\nI hope  it was worth it for you -Flamingo- to try to screw us out of $1000 because I can promise that no one in our 20 person party, many of which are Las Vegas regulars, or anyone any of us ever talk to about it will stay at your hotel. Ceasars is lucky that we love their other properties so much, especially Paris.","date":"2017-08-16 13:59:00"}

We get there and they put my husband and 70 year old dad right in the middle of traffic.  In a very claustrophobic booth.  We ask to move after ordering our drinks.  Took 20 minutes to get our drinks even after we told both waitresses and the hostess helped us move.  Pops and I both ordered the 16oz prime rib so we could have leftovers for lunch the next day.   They bring out our prime ribs and say our baked potatoes are on the way.  Pictures attached.  Almost half of it was fat.  I said oh my gosh that's a lot of fat.  Waitress says nothing.   \nPops and my hubby ordered salads and I ordered mushrooms as my other side.   They bring my daughters and husbands meals came.  A few minutes later we get out baked potatoes.   Hubby says where is my potato?   Well they had given him my mushrooms and he was well on his way of eating them.   So you would think I'd get new mushrooms right?  Nope.  Just slide the half eaten mushrooms to my plate.   Then we order another round of drinks and it takes 20 minutes to get a half chill fireball shot.    \nSo not a good experience.  If I'm paying $25 for a 16oz prime rib, I should get \"close\" to 16oz.  Not 8oz of meat and 8oz of fat.   \nAlso it's supposed to be unlimited bread.  How many loaves do you think we got?  Yup 1.  \nNot a happy experience.","date":"2017-01-27 22:16:46"}

The intercontinental suites are simply ok.  They're clean, they make your bed, bring you towels, etc.  But for the price, I have to give them only 2 stars.  \n\nOn the overpriced side, they're well over $100\/day for a std room, plus parking is $16 \/ day, plus wireless for $10 \/ day.  For that price in Cleveland, I expect at least something special.  That simply wasn't to be found at the Suites.\n\nI ordered room service.  Prices were on par with room service and delivery time was very fast, but my salad appeared as if it had been made a few hours ago and shrink wrapped.  They had a lame selection of beer on room service too.  They didn't even have single beers on their menu, they sold it by the six pack.  I managed to get a single bass which was palatable, but if you've read my other reviews, you know I like the local stuff better.  \n\nThe exercise room is pathetic, they converted a former guest room into an exercise room by removing the furniture and throwing in a bike, treadmill, and maybe an elliptical.  I don't remember for sure what was there. I took one look at it and walked out in disgust.  I went for a run instead, but you better know the area if you're going to do the same.  It's not too far from some places you definitely don't want to get lost in.  Head to the university and stay on campus.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice hotel in the area, I hear the other intercontinental is much better including an enormous workout facility.  If you find this place on the cheap and just need a place to crash, it's great for that.","date":"2008-10-04 17:40:27"}

Kit runs a nice and unique spot which is rarely seen these days - her vision is clear and focused in the decor, product assortment and services provided by the boutique.  \"Boutique\" truly is the appropriate word to use here, as the focus here isn't all about just turning product - she takes her time to educate and curate a broad array of interesting and cutesy little products that are not easily found elsewhere.  Outside of succulents, there is a finely collected assortment of little planters, pots and decorative items for creating your own miniature diorama.  My wife and I went to Plant It to participate in their succulent planting workshop.  The experience was wonderful.  Kit was hospitable, educational and created a very welcoming and fun environment for the experience.  We both enjoyed it very much - Kit helped document the process via taking photos, and guided us both in the selection, care and the assembly process.  Highly recommended--we will be back.\n\nNote: Plant It does not only have succulents, but also these cool \"sleeping flowers\" which are living, last 10 years, are low maintenance and come in some fantastic neon colors.  A great place for gift ideas, favors and sprucing up your place.","date":"2017-01-14 23:15:29"}

Well now we do! Haha, and unfortunately for my waistline it's uncomfortably close to my house, and just as good as it was in the states. Not much was lost in the cross-border translation. From the bright red and white self-congratulatory decor, to the awesome food and the giant bins of peanuts that fill the room and sate your appetite as you wait for your food: everything has come North. \nThe burgers are big (the standard burger is two patties) juicy and fresh. I like to keep the toppings simple (ketchup, mustard, mayo, lettuce, pickles), but there's pretty much anything you could want to put on them on the menu. The sesame seed bun does the job holding the messy burgers together and the processed cheese makes the burger creamy and adds just the right amount of flavour without taking away from the burger.\nThe fries are on par with the burger and as good as some chip truck fries:  big, fresh and crispy. And, as mentioned above, unless your incredibly hungry a regular fries can serve 2 easily and a large more. They actually measure out a heaping portion of fries and dump them in the bag loose to match the portion they give you in the container.\nIt's not cheap, you're looking at 25 dollars plus for two (share a fries and share a drink: there are free refills), but honestly it feels like you're easily getting your money's worth. No other burger chain comes close.","date":"2014-02-05 18:37:14"}

This place was a disappointment from beginning to end for us.\n\nFirst thing you need to know is that if you look at the menu, the only place the word prime shows up is in the title.  The steaks are not prime.  And they definitely do not taste like prime steaks.  They may have prime steaks on the menu, but unless it specifically says it is, it ain't.  \n\nSecondly, the service here sucks.  No sugar coating here.  I don't want people to make the same mistake I made and eat here when there is definitely much better in this town.  Go elsewhere for good service, or at least average service.\n\nWell, hopefully I've dissuaded you.  If not, or if you just like reading about poor dinners like watching a car accident, read on.  \n\nWe ordered the crabcakes.  And this is where the problems started.  We dutifully split it in half as usual, I began eating and noted it was good, then I bit into a crab shell.  Wow, that hasn't happened to me at any decent restaurant and I've had my share of crabcakes.  Disappointed but willing to overlook this, I bit into another piece of shell.  I'm paying a pretty decent sum for a crabcake that isn't remarkable in any way, and I'm biting into shells?  Unbelievable.\n\nNext up, the salads.  Except we didn't order salads.  They were for the table next to us.  With some horror I realized that our steaks and another table's salads were on the sam f-ing cart, but they served their salad first!  I don't think they do that kind of thing at a Black Angus, much less a restaurant that claims to be a top steakhouse.  Horrified but willing to ignore the two insults already suffered, we got our steaks and sides after a bit of a pause.  \n\nMy steak was ok.  18 oz bone-in ribeye.  The sauces weren't special but I'm not much of a sauce guy.  However, if you are going to pride yourself on your sauces, it should generate some interest from me.  Sides were decent.  Truffled mash potatoes were creamy, creamed spinach was what I expected.  I didn't much enjoy the bread though.  I got a pretzel roll that was extremely salty.  \n\nAnd then the final insult.  We finished our steaks, and waited a long time for our waiter to come back, but we didn't see him again.  The second cleaned up and brought us out the dessert menu, but that took quite some time.  At this point I hadn't seen our waiter in so long I assumed he actually left.  I thought that was incredibly rude to do that without turning the table over to someone.  Why are we ordering dessert still?  I wanted to give this place a chance to right the wrongs.  After ordering the crepe suzette (17 layers!), we waited a long time for our dessert.  A real long time.  And after finishing what I thought was a good dessert, we waited a long time for our check.  At this point our waiter returned!  We hadn't seen him since we ordered.  Apparently he had been taking care of another table.  He didn't tell us this, which would have alleviated a lot of the insult I felt by this time.  He cleared our dessert and we wanted no more of this restaurant.  It took a full 15 minutes for him to bring us our checks.  By this point we were angry.  We got here at about 6:45, and it was now 9:15.  So we spent an equal amount of time being seated, ordering and eating as we did waiting on our dessert and paying our check.  I won't be back here when there is so much better in town.","date":"2010-11-22 05:30:32"}

They've got the most delicious fortune cookies and even though the messages are usually something stupid about sports like \"Oh you're gonna have a good sportsball game tomorrow\" you can still enjoy the cookie, and you've already swiped a second one to enjoy later so you're the real winner - sportsball or not.","date":"2014-02-23 22:01:54"}

My Nissan Juke was very good to me so I decided I want to stay with Nissan. My first experience was great with the first vehicle. \n\nI've been looking around at the new Nissan Murano. I recently visited Avondale Nissan just to test drive and discuss costs. The people there were very rude and turned me off on buying a new car any time soon. \n\nThe other day I received a personal text from Bryson asking if I was in the market to buy a new car, which I have been. I told him what I wanted over text and about my Juke and finances. He was able to write up a deal and call me with the info which made the process easy! Saved so much time that could have been wasted at the dealership if the numbers didn't come out right. And they got my interest rate at 3.24 when Avondale Nissan was trying to give me 7% which is higher than the rate of my first car when I had zero credit. My credit  is in the 700's so there is no way I should have been ripped off at 7% like Avondale Nissan tried. \n\nI was offered a trade in value of $9700 at the other dealership. At pinnacle they gave me $12000 which significantly more and paid off my previous loan; even giving me some extra towards the price of my new Murano. \n\nI was impressed by my experience. John in financing was fantastic and very good at explaining the process. Bryson was also very helpful in making the process as easy as possible. \n\nI'm picky and the Murano i wanted wasn't available in Arizona so they found it in Nevada and had it shipped. I was told about 4 days and put into a loaner Murano. My new Murano came in a day in a half and is exactly what I wanted. \n\nI appreciate the professionalism of the staff here.","date":"2016-07-14 18:57:56"}

Even make a donation to their charity every time I shop there. Tonight's treatment by Chris and the cashier was unaccepptable. I was trying out different brands of dog kibble. Bought a high quality brand  a couple weeks ago. My dogs wouldn't eat it. Exchanged that for two different brands a week ago (Purina beyond and Hills diet). My dogs wouldn't go near the food. The Hills brand smelled awful. So I went to return the food. I walked in. Saw only one receipt was in the bag. I went to my vehicle to find the other one. When I came back, Chris is standing a few feet away from the register holding my receipt watching for me. I asked if there was a problem. His reply \"well yeah.\" He begins questioning me why I am returning the merchandise and mentions I seem to be continuously returning items. His question felt like he was interrogating me. I immediately took offense to his attitude and demeanor towards me. I said, my dogs wouldn't eat either one and one brand smells horrible. And proceeded to say I only returned one bag of food previously. Never returned any items prior to that. The prior cashier who helped me last time let me know food items can be returned if the dogs won't eat the food. Chris continued his line of questioning asking me what am I feeding the dogs now. Am I exchanging for another bag. I answered his questions and I shouldn't have had to. It's none of his business what I feed them now. And I do not want another bag. I'm upset. Frustrated by his actions and I rightfully tell him so. Telling him how I feel he is making me feel. I grabbed my receipt from him which he was holding onto tightly showing I am not liking his service. handed it back to the cashier and Chris continues to tell me, he is allowing the return. Absolutely right he is. Their no hassle free return policy was a huge hassle. I'm clearly unhappy and Chris continues to be a condescending on purpose by asking if there anything more he could do for me. I responded with after they way he treated me, I'm going to ask him for help. He continued his belligerent responces in which I told him to stop. How dare he treat me with such disrespect.

Using the overused term \"hidden gem\" really doesn't do Alexander Michael's proper justice. This place is so tucked within Fourth Ward, you most likely wouldn't notice it even if you were to traipse the entire neighborhood. Which, in my opinion, really makes this place shine. There's no grandiose entry way or signage laid out in lights. Just an old house on the corner of 9th with low lighting and a cozy interior. \n\nHINT: If you've never been here, I'd recommend cutting all the way over to Graham St and then turning onto 9th. You can't turn down 9th from Tryon, as 9th is split into two sections and you won't be able to drive direct. Also, parking is sparse. Find a place around the neighborhood and walk a few blocks. There is plenty of residential 2hr parking on the streets. \n\nSat at the bar and loved every creek and crack of the old floors and pillars. It's kind of tight quarters, but it gives it a cool pub feel. The taps coming directly out of the old cabinet style system is just gorgeous. Tons of local brews and some other fine beer choices were available. Didn't indulge as it was a 1pm lunch. I ended up order the london broil sandwich. Goodness gracious I'm glad I did, too. It was just right for lunch and paired with the pasta salad, you can't go wrong. \n\nService is so friendly here.

Two days ago while we stayed at Caesars Palace, my friend insisted to have some to-go order of Chinese food within the hotel despite my objection. So, we went.\n\nWe ordered a BBQ Platter ($29.99), a Pork Ribs in Sweet Vinegar Sauce ($19.99), and one order of custard bun - Egg Yolk Quicksand as they called it ($6.99). In total, we paid over $60 for these three items. \n\nI was astonished to see the BBB Platter when we got back to the room and opened the box. This platter was about half the size of the same dish I ordered once there two years ago. In the combination platter, there were three kinds of meat - 4 very small pieces of Poached chicken, 4 very small pieces of Roast Duck and BBB Pork. I almost couldn't believe they were serving so few pieces of so tiny size at such quite high price. As to the BBB Pork, it was chopped (not slicked) into pieces about 5 times thicker than normal sliced BBQ Pork served at most other restaurants. Their poor and tacky knife cut made the BBQ Pork look as dull as a portion of pig's frozen dead body, totally unappetizing and iffy. I was wondering how they could charge $30 for a small box of food with quality level lower than that of a food court vendor. \n\nI must give a low rating to this restaurant again. I am a Chinese and I know how good Chinese food should look and should be prepared. They still don't think they should upgrade, instead they shrink the portion and size of the food and raise the prices with no business ethics at all. Doesn't Caesars Palace feel ashamed to allow such a low-end place sitting there to fool and rip off non-Chinese tourists and suckers?\n\nAfter this bad experience, I checked again their recent ratings on Yelp and found they've got more and more poor ratings. They deserve for what they are doing, and I believe if they continue doing so, they won't stay there too long.","date":"2017-08-16 04:15:55"}

I'm either looking to gain 1000 lbs or am busy.  I'll take the busy option.  So since i was stuffed from an incredible waffle from Sugar Cafe I decided to get my fav salad of the moment, a beet salad.  It was a pretty big disappointment.  I'd say it was MAYBE 1\/3 a beat with TINY little cubes of beets, lettuce leaves and blue cheese.  Blue Cheese with beats?  No feta, really?!  Ok, I'm looking too much into this beet salad, but for realz, it was sorta lame.  \n\nOur server was OK, but sorta seemed like she wasn't into serving that day.  She kept forgetting to bring my friend her drink and she just seemed pretty lackadaisical.  No big thang I guess, I served and I was horrible!!  The outdoor patio was also really cute.  I was actually really into the whoel feel of the place, inside and out.  Very romantic in and very casual and comfy outside.  \n\nService was pretty slow too.  ALTHOUGH, what I will say in their defense is it looks like they only have two small grills in the front to make the crepes (which my two friends got) so I can see why it would take a while.

I placed my order around 4:30pm directly on their website. Anyway, it is clearly marked that they deliver to the H9R area.  One can also find this restaurant listed on the Tasty Boom food delivery service as well.  I have double checked that I am indeed part of the delivery zone.  I received an order confirmation from Tasty Boom (as they are in charge of all the online orders).  After waiting for an hour and half I called the restaurant's direct line.  The person who picked up told me that a representative from Tasty Boom was supposed to call me because they had decided to cancel the order.  I never received any phone call, text, or e-mail stating that the order had been cancelled.  The Mr. Falafel employee also asked me, \"If I just placed a bunch of things in my order to make the minimum?\"  I then explained to him that I ordered what I wanted.  Also, I am not sure why \"what\" I decide to order is any of his concern as long as I meet the delivery requirements.  I expect that even if I was just ordering extra things I still would expect the food to be delivered.  I then called Tasty Boom and they told me that the restaurant had chosen to cancel the order because they felt like it wasn't \"worth it\" for them to deliver.  I would like to note that the website states a $20.00 minimum and my order was $25.00.  Also, the restaurant is located on Saint Jean's Boulevard and is a less than 10 minute drive from my location even with lots of traffic...what a joke and what a waste of time.","date":"2018-03-03 23:23:37"}

We paid ~ $750 for three week nights in October.  \n\nLocation:  Fabulous because it was near the quaint old town area with plenty of areas to stroll through and pick up breakfast.  1 block away from the metro stop and about 3 blocks from China Town.  About 5 blocks from the water front and Archeology museum.  \n\nService:  Very friendly and tried to be professional but some odd answers to my questions.   They seemed to always try to sell their own restaurant whenever we wanted suggestions from the concierge...even when we asked to find St.Viateur for their famous bagels.  I also tried to get a room with a good view - one of the customer service reps said she would try, since the rooms were not ready when we arrived.  But then another service rep looked at her and mumbled something in French... She then said that our room does have a good view and then within the same sentence, said that really, there were not good views in this hotel.  Then, our toilet had very low water pressure so I called the front desk who said they would relocate us to another room. 15 minutes later, after frantically packing our things, a guy comes up to the room and says no other rooms are available and they would fix it in the a.m.   \"A\" for effort but \"C\" for the odd answers and possibly... lack of experience? \n\nRooms:  Loved the brick walls and hard wood floors INSIDE the rooms - a lot of personality with very high ceilings.  Big bathroom with full bath.  Good blow dryer in the room, iron and board, umbrella, robes, iphone\/ipod dock on radio.  Bed was a bit firm for me (I am soft biased) but otherwise comfy.  \n\nFitness room:  small but my husband said was good enough - had cardio machines and weights.  \n\nWe received a free drink voucher for their restaurant upon checkin.  Our friends also stayed in the hotel and opted to buy package deal that included 4 free metro passes and coupons... not sure how much more they spent but they also got a bigger room.","date":"2012-11-06 08:11:22"}

You could tell they were really trying to make an impression.  I returned there about 2 weeks ago for AYCE and the experience was quite different.  I went early, about 11:30 a.m. because I knew they are much busier.  There were only 4 other people in the restaurant.  I ordered my first round and as I waited, the restaurant filled up quickly.  I waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  When my first order of sushi arrived, it wasn't everything I ordered but I was glad it came because it took the edge off.  I slowly received more sushi.  The 3 orders of eel that I ordered never came.  I reminded the server.  She said she would check on it.  I waited some more.  I asked her for the 2nd time about the eel.  Even though the restaurant was practically full, she was the only server working, ping-ponging from table to table.  Since I had nothing to do I kept an eye on this poor guy at the bar who wasn't even acknowledged for at least 1\/2 an hour, not even to be given water.  He kept trying to get someone's attention!  Finally about 12:15, what I thought was another server arrived, turned out he was a bus boy and could only pick up plates and fill water.  FINALLY my eel arrived, it was super mushy, was much larger than the other sushi and didn't have that warm toasted crust.  You could tell it was thrown together.  Since I made such a big deal out of it, I ate it all even though I didn't like it.  I felt so sick after that, even though I didn't get my money's worth I didn't want any more (she wouldn't have been around to take another order anyway).  I was in the restaurant for well over an hour even though when I arrived I was one of 5 people there.  Then on the way out I noticed a dead roach on the floor, I nearly threw up.  The quality and service went way down with this place which is unfortunate.","date":"2015-07-16 06:55:28"}

It's not a sleazy, cheapo place. It's cozy and professional.\n\nLong version: My husband and I decided to make an impromptu trip to Las Vegas. We booked our hotel two days in advance and winged it while we were there. We knew, though, that we wanted to get a couples massage.\n\nOf course, we headed to Yelp, and read lots of good reviews for the hotel spas, but oh my gosh--$400 for a 50 minute massage? Ouch. No thanks. So, I Googled \"couples massage\" and came up with three non-day spa\/hotel places in Vegas. I called all three, checked reviews on all three, and then checked appointment availability and came up with Massage Pro. Booked an appointment sight unseen, and crossed my fingers.\n\nThe place is right off the strip--just head west on Sahara for a couple miles. It'd be too much to walk, I think, but it's close enough that taking a taxi shouldn't be too expensive. We had our car with us and it was a very quick drive.\n\nWhen my husband and I walked into the office, we were a little worried--the reception is super small and feels a little like a dentist's office. We filled out our paperwork, and were taken back to a much more spacious waiting room with dimmed lights, relaxing music, and a little fountain. From there, we were met by our massage therapists. We did have to wait a little longer than we expected, but it was only seven minutes beyond our appointment time, and they more than made up for it during the session. I think they spent an extra ten or fifteen minutes on us to make it up to us. :)\n\nWe ordered the 90-minute combination massage, which was a blend of Swedish and deep-tissue techniques. We paid just $90 each! Even with a $20 tip on top of each massage, we were still under the next least expensive massage we could find--and the experience was phenomenal!\n\nWe had a male therapist and a female therapist (we had confirmed this was all right when we called and made our appointments) who guided us to a designated Couples Room specially set aside for couples massages. The room was decorated, dimmed, and had soothing music playing. The beds were heated and we were asked if they were to our liking temperature-wise. They were perfect.\n\nDid I mention the therapists are nationally and locally licensed? Yeah. Cool.\n\nSo began ninety minutes of rubby, relaxing bliss. The therapists were receptive to our suggestions--a little softer on that spot, please; a little harder right there. The therapists were nothing but the utmost of professionals, watching our muscles for the relaxation of knots and responses to too much pressure. They adjusted their techniques to our preferences and my husband and I had a wonderfully relaxing afternoon. We had very enjoyable massages.\n\nWe didn't pack robes with us, and, not being a day spa, they don't provide them, so they were kind enough to let us use their shower usually reserved for customers getting body scrubs so we could rinse off some of the massage lotion. We got big, fluffy towels to dry off with and they even gave us an extra one, just in case.\n\nIn short:\nUNBEATABLE prices\nProfessional, personable, skilled, licensed, receptive therapists\nCouples massage room!\nNot a day spa--ambiance is definitely service-oriented, but still decorated and cozy\nAwesome massage\nNot sketchy (they have zero tolerance for inappropriate behavior)\n\nWhat are you waiting for?! Book your vacation massage for less than the price of most show tickets!","date":"2011-04-22 01:38:45"}

No thanks!\" I was recently in Las Vegas the week of Independence Day for a poker tournament and my back was hurting so much that I was having difficulty sitting at the tables for long periods of time. I got massages for three days in a row but got only a small amount of temporary relief. I thought about going to a chiropractor, but remembered how many times my friend had tried to get me to see her acupuncturist and decided I should give it at least one try. Boy, am I glad I did! \n\nThe needles are very, very fine and I only felt a small prick with a few (not even close to either a vaccination or finger stick)-- this was NOT a painful procedure. He inserted 16 of them from my neck to my ankles and then asked me to guess how many were there. I guessed 6-8. I seriously didn't even feel the others and none of them hurt. They then hooked some kind of electrodes to 6 of them (I was lying face down and couldn't see what he was doing) and sent weak electrical pulses through them. If you've ever had TINS treatments, the amount of current was far less (no muscle twitches) and felt as if someone was gently tapping my back in each spot. Then, they turned off the lights and played New Age type music while I relaxed. I don't know how long that lasted (maybe 15-20 minutes?) because I didn't have my watch on, but it was like taking a nap. After this time, they disconnected the electrodes and removed the needles. I felt very calm and a little groggy at this point. I had told him that I would be playing poker later that evening and he recommended that I take a nap when I returned to my hotel. I took his advice and when I awoke, I felt great! In fact, I was even able to walk from Caesar's to Bally's later to catch the free shuttle without any pain. Sure, that's not a great distance, but there is no way I could have done that prior to my acupuncture treatment. I got a second treatment the next day (my last full day in town) and when I left Las Vegas, I was pain free. Just today (about 10 days later) my lower back pain has been bothering me again (though not as severe), so tomorrow morning I will look up the local doctor whom my friend recommended. I hope he is as good as Dr. Lok! If you are in Las Vegas and have back pain, you really need to go to Dr. Lok.","date":"2012-07-16 04:33:37"}

These folks have less than no clue about what customer service is. My brother moved to Scottsdale from Minneapolis. He arrived well ahead of his PODS container. However, when the container did arrive no one bothered calling to let him know his unit had arrived. When he called them he was told, \"Oh yeah. The container arrived last week.\" It never occurred to anyone to let my bro know that his container had arrived.\nNext was the issue of trying to schedule delivery of the unit to his home. Problem is, no one at PODS location has any discernible grasp of how production scheduling works. All they were interested in telling him is that there will be extra fees for overtime because they're so busy. Since when are the internal logistics problems at PODS any concern of the client? Thankfully, my brother is a very persuasive bloke and he takes very little guff from incompetent lackeys. Of course he paid no additional fees, but a more timid individual would likely be held up for extra charges.\nAnd then there's the challenge of trying to contact PODS. All communication and billing are handled at a centralized call center, and it's a typical call center staffed by individuals who are paid far too little to give a crap about people calling in with questions, problems, and concerns. So, if you want to contact the local location to see if the unit has arrived...no dice! You get to deal with a call center lackey.\nMy brother did give a positive shout-out to the guys PODS sent out to empty out his home in Minneapolis and load the container. They damaged only two pieces of furniture and they didn't break near as many fragile items as he was expecting they would, so he was pretty pleased with that.\nBottom line here is that until PODS matures and figures out its logistics issues, timing issues, and customer service issues, you'll do much better with U-Haul or Atlas Van Lines.","date":"2015-11-18 19:10:00"}

I've never Jason Biggs'd a pie before, but the s.r. has definitely gotten a couple of suggestive glances from me.\n\nAs for the service, the employees are always very sweet, helpful, and have been known to give out free apple cider at times.\n\nI also can't complete this review without mentioning the Apple band. That's right, a Chuck-E-Cheese-esque Apple band is occasionally available to play on their mini-stage...you just have to catch them at the right time. Those apple rock stars can be pretty big divas.","date":"2011-05-27 07:01:13"}

When he  worked with us, he was helpful and tried to find games we would like. While two folks can be assigned to a booth, I would recommend only one. I also would recommend that he give an orientation to the whole group to save time. Each person was given an orientation which cost us time, but we were able to stay a few minutes over, so this was less of an issue. Finally, there is a maze activity on the same level.

It didn't really go well with the other offerings. I love lamb, and wish they could have had something a little less wacky. The Parmesan pork was ok, not great - a little bland. The various beef cuts were amazing though, and I loved the garlic chicken. Our whole party pretty much burst into laughter at the waiter 's suggestion of dessert. Their poor pastry chef doesn't get much call for work, as I think most people do NOT save room for dessert. \n\nThe on tap list was very nice, was pleased to see Crispen cider there (as I am not much of a beer drinker), and the wine list was quite large.

It's dimly lit, with beautiful dark wood and a fully stocked bar waiting for you to imbibe. \n\nThey have six wines right now, but the grapes are crushed fresh in house (or at least in the presence of the winemaker, Tim), so you know they're not rushing to produce a mass amount of products, just a handful of marvelous blends! My fave of the moment is the Malbec. I've been really into it for a while now and really love their blend. I honestly have had some pretty bad ones, and this is true to form. I also think this is such a white wine type of area, I'm glad to see a place putting effort into promoting the reds.\n\nBut here's the other cool thing. They have a downstairs area that matches the same cool vibe of the upstairs. It's thee perfect place for an unique event. It apparently fits around 100 and would be the perfect pick for a small reception or a hip party. I wouldn't care what kind of event it was, I'd want to crash it here! \n\nThey also offer custom labeling, so if you ever need a unique gift this is the way to go!

Let me start by clarifying an inaccurate statement, Blue Martini does not take reservations on Sunday night. They actually are attempting to change a Bar Restaurant into a Night Club on Sunday nights. \nNeo-Soul, a promotion company operating on Sunday's has increased their visceral attitude toward anyone not willing to pay 300 dollars for a  bottle service on Sundays.  On Sunday August 7, 2016, I visited the Blue Martini as I always do several times a month.   During my visits I normally spend  around 100 dollars.  After checking online banking I discovered that I have spent approximately 500 dollars since mid May.\nYesterday I ordered chicken wings and a cocktail around 730pm.  I waited 45 minutes for my wings.  I look forward to eating BM wings on Sunday since it is the only day that I eat Chicken.   Half way through my chicken wings a Neo soul representative came over to where I was sitting with a retired engineer.and a VA Nurse.\nThe unknown Neo soul promoter described as early 30's, black male, bald head and bow tie, failed to introduce himself.  The first thing out of his mouth was \"Other women are wondering why you have a stool to eat your dinner with. He further stated, I have to ask you if either of you two are disabled\" (he clearly was the one to ask about disabilities).. I was embarrassed that he would stand by with a security officer while I ruffled through my purse in the dark for 3 minutes. I assumed he would be allowing me a reasonable accommodation after forcing me to reveal my disability and showing my credentials.  Instead he was throwing me out of my stool and escorting me way in the back where they hid chairs for Profit.  The promoters actions were consistent with some one without knowledge of Restaurant Regulations.  \" if a patron orders food from a bar that patron should be afforded a proper bar stool\".  Meaning,If a patron orders food from a Blue Martini Bartender at a bar and pays for the meal a bar stool,and proper eating utensils  MUST be provided. Blue Martini can't profit from a customer and then not provide a stool in order for Neo Soul to increase it profits.  The Neo Soul rep. appeared surprised when I produced my Armed forces Veterans disability ID as if he was not expecting that. I explained to him I was a Desert Storm Veteran and retired from the armed forces and Las Vegas Metro.  He then told me to grab my half eaten chicken wings in order to place me out of the way in the back.  I was not going to pay several hundred dollars for a bottle service and chicken wings to hear the same band so that I could sit down for ten minutes to eat.  I asked him if there was an emergency and why I could not eat my last two chicken wings.   I explained that it would not be unreasonable to allow a disabled veteran to finish two wings and then move.  He said \"Let's take the disabled veteran out of it\".  I asked why when he was the one that interjected the disability as a prerequisite to a bar stool which is inconsistent with restaurant  practices. It is also unsanitary to drag your food around in the dark .  The Neo Soul rep also felt it necessary to have a Blue Martini Security officer stand by as a \"Show of Force.\" We took this as excessive, embarrassing and humiliating because it was for profit.  Neo Soul felt  it necessary to interrupt my dinner  so that Neo could increase profits.  Neo Soul is confusing Blue Martini with nightclub practices. Neo Soul and Blue Martini's failure to fallow guidelines of restaurant\/Bar have generated a multitude of complaints.  Lastly, He continued to make the situation worse by making me stand and eat my remaining two wings.  \n\nNeo Soul claim that by removing seats people are able to get to the bar to order drinks easier are \nfalse. The first bar where more then 25-35 bar stools remain, individuals are allowed to eat and drink around the bar with a proper bar stool. \n\nSecondly, at 815 pm there appeared to be about 5 people at the bar on this particular night.  \nLastly,the stool that was taken from me was moved to a small high table where 3 dancers immediately occupied the table.  \n\nThe entire scene was mishandled and escalated by the Neo Soul rep.  The rep who hides dozens of chairs from restaurant goers was unnecessary and purely for profit.  I would like to reiterate the fact that,  You absolutely cannot make reservations. This entire \"rigged system\"  is sit up to increase the profits of the unprofessional Neo Soul reps desperate to make more money. \n\nI asked  to speak with a Manager at this point.  This manager can only be described as stocky, Latino with a neatly trimmed beard.  He was extremely professional and apologized for the behavior of the Neo Soul representative's behavior.  He further stated that Neo Soul Rep was unprofessional and to contact Scotty M immediately.\nAdditionally, he offered to purchase my chicken wings and I said \"thank you but If you could give us some drink tickets instead.","date":"2016-08-13 01:29:59"}

It used to be unlimited, along with all the thinly sliced beef, pork, and sliced chicken, seafood (including crab legs and shrimp), veggies that you can DIY cook in the hot pot at your table.  But for what you are getting and what they are charging, it is still a good value proposition. Come on, for $20 a person without the hassle of getting all the ingredients yourself and the cleaning up afterwards, totally worth it! \n\nI first came to Shabu Grill all the way to this section of LV because of an UYE hosted by Debbie N.  The event was a resounding success, and we pretty much got to try as much of their menu as we were able to stuff down our faces.\n\nSo when a guys night out event was recently organized at this very same location, it was a no brainer for me.  The food is still very good, the service was just as attentive, and the experience just as positive.  The restaurant even accommodated us with extra portable hot pot setups, so 2 instead of 4 or 5 people shared each hot pot.  It just worked out better for us.\n\nThe main reason I like this place is the fact that everything for the shabu shabu portion of the dining experience is DIY, including getting the ingredients from the refrigerated cooler nearby.  I love the fact that I can get as little or as much of something, instead of being forced to finished big plates of one item before I can order more or something else.  \n\nThe DIY sauce and condiments bar is pretty cool.  Not as extensive as comparable restaurants in SoCal, but you get to customize your dipping sauces as wonderfully or not so fantastically as your creativity and inner toque wearing chef would allow.  But it is pretty hard to score a TOTAL FAIL in this minor endeavor, so relax and just have a go at it.  The important thing is to have fun and enjoy this interactive meal solo, but preferably with a small group of friends.\n\nI would totally go back, especially when the weather is still very nippy in the evening.\n\nNote:  There is a \"bar\" in the front when you walk in, but they do NOT serve alcohol at this establishment.  But if you have room for some beer or other adult beverages, there is a PT in the same strip mall.\n\n\n\nReview #2 of 2014","date":"2014-01-17 04:05:45"}

I \"Yelped\" banh mi sandwiches for Phoenix last night because I was craving one and wanted to find out what Yelpers out there think are the best.  I was a bit surprised to see Reathrey on the list as they are not a Vietnamese restaurant, but having patronized the restaurant at least a half dozen times, I decided to read through the reviews.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I originally went to the restaurant after reading the glowing article in Phoenix Magazine.  Our first visit there was pretty uneventful.  We ordered the Mi Keaw soup, spring rolls and the crepe (which by the way was served slightly burned with that side facing down- but I never complain about my food and ordered it again on later visits).  My only real complaint that first evening was the incredibly uncomfortable bench seating.  On subsequent visits we opted for the tables in the center of the space.  I have tried a number of different things on the menu and while having no other Cambodian food to compare it to I find it to be just meahhh.  My boyfriend on the other hand loves the Mi Keaw soup and has ordered it as take out a number of times and is the reason for our repeat business.  In my opinion the Pho at many valley Vietnamese restaurants is much tastier.\n\nOkay - back to the reason for the one star review.  So here I was reading through the reviews when I started coming across the owner's incredibly RUDE, SARCASTIC, CONDESCENDING, DISRESPECTFUL and downright UNACCEPTABLE responses to his less than stellar reviews.  I have three words for you GET OVER YOURSELF!!! I don't care if you are running a Michelan star rated restaurant (which CLEARLY you are not) that type of disgusting behavior will run your business into the ground.

I needed one very badly, having been using a relative's vehicle for several months, but that they now needed back. I had planned ahead and done my research, and wanted a Ford CMax Hybrid. My work offered a discount\/cash-back deal through Cars.com, so I submitted the request and my info was sent to Berge. My plan was to take advantage of the 4th of July weekend specials.\n\nI was almost immediately sent an email from a salesman named Chris. He wanted to know what I was looking for in a vehicle. I replied right away with the details... But the only email address given was a generic one, nothing direct. There was no response. A few days later, he sent me another email, this time with a map to the dealership, but with no indication my reply was received. I replied back, asking for some quotes, but again got no response. I was anxious with the impending July 4th weekend, but held hope I could still make contact. I decided to call. \n\nUnfortunately, the only number he gave me was his personal cell. That Friday after work, I called and was immediately sent to voicemail. I got a text saying he was at dinner, but would return my call. I left a voicemail explaining that I badly needed a car, either from him or someone else at the dealership, and that he hasn't actually replied to my emails (maybe he forgot to check the general inbox?) and I asked him to call me  back ASAP. I really needed the July 4th specials. \n\nThe weekend came and went, no reply from Chris. Frustrated, I went to a different dealership in Scottsdale and worked with wonderful people, and that next weekend negotiated a deal on a beautiful CMax that made up for missing out on both the holiday weekend deals and the cash-back deal through my work. TWO WEEKS LATER Chris emails me to say their servers were out of commission, which is why he didn't get my emails, and he would love to help me into a car (this all being said in poor spelling and no caps or punctuation ).\n\nMy brother was a car salesman for awhile, so I have a pretty good idea how it goes. I was only given his personal cell number so he could make sure he got my sale instead of anyone else. I'm also an IT student, so I have a very hard time believing their servers were down for two whole weeks.

It is a pretty good value and always delicious. Fresh naan is served upon arrival and the buffet always offers some type of chicken curry or masala and tandoori chicken,palak paneer, veggie curries, salad, sometimes goat curry and a few other options. It also has Chai, but it isn't good. I don't recommend coming for dinner. The menu is a la carte and a bit pricey for what you get. The portion sizes are very small and you don't get any rice or naan. We ordered a goat curry dish and chicken curry dish and there was only about 5-6 pieces of meat in the dish servings. They ran about $13-15 too! We expected a lot more for that price. I think rice and\/or naan should come standard with dishes here (especially in that price range). The service is always spectacular and super friendly.","date":"2017-05-13 05:44:56"}

Rex Marvin is that person. Rex Marvin's search for the greatest food and the most huffable gasoline makes him the tragic figure that in literature would get the girl, save the day, and have the most severed heads in jars in his basement (if it was a Disney book).  The good news people, is that all of those things in real life are true.  If you consider a graveside ditch near the freeway to be a \"basement\".  Rex does. Recently, Rex was accosted for no reason.  Rex and his woman, Three Legged Midget Maggie, were minding our own business.  Rex was casually tossing TLMM up in the air until she was able to grab onto a ledge and let herself in.  Rex tossed her and she didn't come down. A sure sign that TLMM has accomplished her mission. Rex turns around to have 4 metro cops staring at him. They were big. They were not smiling.  Rex decided to break the ice.  Rex asked \"How many buy one get one free garden hose or industrial blacktop sealant coupons does it take to get 4 cops to walk away and pretend like they saw nothing?\" The next thing Rex knew he saw flashes of light. Rex smiled. Darkness. Rex woke up on the floor of a squad car while the cops talked about the loser they beat and were taking into custody. It must have been someone else.\n\nRex's left eye was shut but he saw that they had stopped at a gas station. They talked about food. They were getting gas station pasta. The smaller one looked back to check on Rex, and said that he was in the mood for \"frozen noodles in sauce\". Rex closed his eyes and tried not to vomit at the idea. He felt with his food that the back door wasn't closed all the way. Rex dislocated his wrists, slipped off the cuffs, and pushed the door open...and much like the time Rex woke up in Candice Bergen's bedroom...he was out before something that could never been taken back happened.  Not going to jail...no Rex can do hard time...but smelling heated frozen pasta is something that Rex will not endure.  Rex has endured more than most. Remember, Rex lived in drag as Jodi Foster's lesbian lover for 3 years...Rex HAS ENDURED! Still everyone has a line not to cross. One of Rex's is frozen pasta...the other is participating in the underground black market 8 track tape racket...lucrative, but Rex only needs to lose 3 toes to know that some money just isn't worth it. Rex has brains.\n\nRex needed to cleanse himself from the memory of that awful experience...so Rex ran. He crawled. He climbed into someone's trunk. He eventually reached the closest place he could find...Manhattan Pizza.  It is in a strip mall behind a bank and near a place that sells fancy popcorn, and none of that bodes well...but ignore the warning signs and go in.\n\nThere are a few staples in an Italian restaurant, and one of them is the Chicken Parm. If you can't make a lights out Chicken Parm then you should close your doors. Manhattan makes a very good one. The chicken is tender, the batter is crispy, the mozzarella is good and the sauce is great. Their red sauce is excellent. Just the right amount of garlic and acidity. The pasta is always cooked well, never over cooked and mushy. The next is meatballs. Manhattan makes a very good meatball; it is almost all meat and no unnecessary fillers. Lastly, can it make a pizza...a great pizza...and Manhattan...excels! Rex is more the New York style pizza kind of man. If you like a doughy crust, you are a hick, and this place might not be for you. They do put a lot of toppings on it, and that is a good thing. \nThe truth about Manhattan is the same truth people say about Rex Marvin...almost everything is good.  There isn't too much Rex hasn't tried he didn't like. The fried foods are all good, with a nod to the mozzarella sticks.  The pastas are all good and have good sauces.  The Alfredo could have some more parmesan cheese in it for Rex's taste, but you shake some more on and it is good.  \n\nThe prices are too high. Period. The food is good, but Rex finds himself not going because for the same amount of money there are better options. If they dropped the prices Rex would eat there a lot more.\n\nThere are a lot worse places to go than Manhattan especially for the pizza. They do a very good job at New York style pizza, not perfect but a very good job.  They obviously care and try hard to make a quality product.  Sometimes they succeed better than others, but it is never awful. Rex can appreciate that. Just like Three Legged Midget Maggie, sometimes it takes a few throws, but she always tries. She always gives an effort...and in the end of the day...that means something.  Rex doesn't know what it means, but it means something.\n\nMahattan isn't Rex's first choice. It isn't even his second or third, but in a pinch it is good. It is really a 2 1\/2 star place. Order right, catch it on the right night, it can be very good. Normally it is just above good. For the money, you can do better than good.","date":"2012-03-01 00:26:47"}

The previous year I went, there were a lot fewer customers. However, despite being full, the cafe was quiet as people worked away or kept their nose behind the newspaper.

They rotate the menu so it's hard to keep up but everything has been delicious.\n\nWhat keeps me from giving it 5 stars? The prices.

On November 25th I don't know what the heck happened but my neck Popped! \n\nYeah my next popped and I could not move my neck! I swear I cried all day because I was in pain. I stayed home thinking by the next day I would feel better. Nope. I was worse. So I looked up for a chiropractor. Keep in mind I also don't have health insurance because that is expensive as hell. \n\nI find this place and it has 5 stars. I call and this amazing nice lady answered the phone. I forgot her name unfortunately but she was so sweet. She told me to go in and the doctor would see me. \n\nI go in and immediately they start working on me. I apparently tore a muscle and that is why I was in pain and could not move my head! I was scared and I talked to Dr. Brandon Wentzel about the wedding I was going to be attending at 6 that day. He promised to make me better and that I would be able to move. \n\nGuess what? He did! I left the doctor place able to move and even though I still had pain it lowered from a 10 to 1! \n\nSO happy to have been able to go here and have two people take care of me and make me better.

The Mexican Rice was really good as was the taco meat, seasoned well and was tasty.  The BBQ sausage was good, and so were the BBQ Chicken Wings.  The BBQ Ribs were tender and tasty.  I had Apple Cobbler and Carrot Cake with frozen Vanilla Yogurt (Ice Cream?) on top.  The quality of everything I ate was better than what is served at other Station Casinos.  The service was good and my drink was filled as needed and dirty plates were removed in a timely manner.  The wait staff was busy but were friendly and asked me if I needed anything several times.

The room is long and narrow, and feels like a cross between a classic diner and an upscale train dining car. Waiters bustle around the tight space creating a fun, busy atmosphere.\n\nWe sat at the bar. No reservations are taken but we walked right in at 6:00.\n\nWe started with beef tartare and fried smelts. The tartare was good and went well with the fresh horseradish included. Smelts were crispy and lightly battered. A nice surprise were the fried jalapenos that went surprisingly well with the fish. The real star though was the free cheesy toast and butter.\n\nThe mains were absolutely delicious. The cornish hen was cooked perfectly crispy and was an umami explosion with mushrooms and spinach, but could have used a tiny bit more salt and\/or sauce. The burger with fried cheese on top was fantastic. Now that the Harbord Room is closed I think this is now my favourite restaurant burger in Toronto.\n\nFor dessert we had the apple pie sundae and a cup of strong coffee.\n\nService was impeccable. My wife was given samples of two wines to compare when she couldn't decide, a touch that I always appreciate. The wine list could be a bit more extensive but this is a quibble. A fantastic new spot.

The biggest issue was that there were only 2 waitresses who were both taking orders and serving food, which made the service very slow. The waitress took about 10 minutes to come around to our table and forgot to ask for what drinks we wanted until I mentioned it. In addition, it took a while to get either waitress' attention when we need ed napkins or extra utensils. Lastly, we had ordered the the Fried Ice Cream with Mango Ice Cream, however, our waitress failed to mention that they only had one flavor of ice cream. When we told her about the mistake, she just curtly explained that they only had one flavor in stock. It was just a frustrating experience.\n\nOverall, the food was good, but the service lacking.

My boyfriend went to U of I and we somehow stumbled upon this hidden gem. Well, I suppose it's not so hidden since there is usually a long wait. But don't be discouraged! The wait is well worth it, I promise. \n\nTry to make your way through the door, find the guy in charge, and put your name on the list. There's not much space in this place. I guess that would be my one complaint. It can get pretty crunched, especially if you're waiting. However, what is better to tide you over than a delicious beer? Now, let's talk about this beer.\n\nThey have new selections on tap all the time. Please, do your beer pallet a favor and don't order the usual domestics and imports (Miller, Bud, Heiniken, Corona, etc). Those are just fine for any regular restaurant. Why miss the glorious opportunity to try something mind-blowingly good? Seriously, these beers are amazing. They come from different breweries across the country. Places\/companies you've never heard of. Combinations of flavors you would never think to try. I once had an oyster beer here. Sounds disgusting but it was so good. Trust me on that. I'm very picky and I liked it. You can also get a flight of 7 beers on a dogbone shaped tray (how fitting!). This flight has all the beers that are on tap in 4 oz glasses. You can share them with a friend and then order the one you like best!\n\nNow, on to the food. So SO good. There are a few different sauce choices you can get. Not being one for spicy, I get the Georgia Peach. It is soo good on anything you get. There is no bad item on this menu. The pulled pork is amazing as are the hamburgers. Hard to believe a hamburger could be so good, but it is. The brisket is also amazing. They cook it for 12 hours. How could it not be? Try to get here relatively early though, because some items like the brisket run out later in the evening. While it's a bummer, think of it as a good thing. This way, you know they're not just heating it in the microwave. They cook it, and once it's gone, it's gone. Oh and the fries are amazing, whether you get the regular or sweet potato.\n\nI know this was a long review, but I really can't say enough about this place. I'm obsessed. It's a bummer that my bf graduated so we can't go all the time since we live near Chicago. However, I will make any excuse to go down. Going there this weekend for Halloween.

The Gyro was indeed huge and the meat was flavorful but the veggies were close to the end of their shelf life. The fries that came with the meal were crap actually, I know that they are fresh cuts fries so lets make sure that they are cooked all the way through and have some sort of uniformity in size and the oil that they were fried in was obviously fairly old.

After moving to Ahwatukee from Central Phoenix a couple of years ago, this location became the closest to me. It used to be reliable and consistent but the last several times I've been, the quality has really suffered. \n\nA few months ago I ordered some take-out for my family.  After getting it home and going to eat my meal, I realized that my order was very wrong.  Now I'd become accustomed to this location forgetting things like sauces for the appetizers, napkins, soy sauce and fortune cookies (things that are supposed to be included with take-out), but my dish was inedible to me.  \n\nI called to complain, the manager was apologetic and offered that I come back and pick up a replacement OR he would send me a gift card to replace my meal.  Since I have an infant that I needed to get to bed, I opted for the gift card.\n\nA month or so went by and my husband suggested Pei Wei.  That's when I realized that I never received the replacement gift card!  We ordered and when my husband picked it up, he mentioned the issue we had the last time and they gave him a discount.  As usual, things were missing from the order (no appetizer sauce, napkins, fortune cookies, etc.) and the food was just okay.\n\nTonight we ordered again, this time the food was just horrible.  Bland, no taste whatsoever for either of our dishes!  I ordered the new Korean BBQ with chicken (I had it before) and really liked it.  My husband had the same but with tofu and vegetables.  Neither of us thought the food was good at all.  The sauce which is normally very tasty was so bland and watery that it literally ran off of the chicken.  The 'salad' that comes with it was wilted and soggy, clearly not fresh.  And as expected, no sauce for the crab wontons, no napkins, no soy sauce & no fortune cookies.  \n\nI don't think we will be going back anytime soon - at least not to this location - they really need to get it together.  We're tired of the issues every time we eat in or get take-out from here.","date":"2011-03-20 02:04:11"}

Not sure if it would be enjoyable in summer, but mid-Feb, with it finally hitting the upper 70s, it was wonderful.  Several people were there w\/ dogs because it is really a picnic area.\n\nWe will go back.  I want to try the ahi salad...maybe stick w\/ the ahi sandwich.  I think it will be the way to go when I'm craving a burger.\n\nW\/o a doubt, if you go, you HAVE to check out the bathrooms.","date":"2011-02-13 16:54:56"}

It's a little piece of King West transplanted at College and Yonge. Above Toronto's landmark breakfast place Fran's, Screen Lounge is a 2-level resto-lounge - I can see hanging out in the sleek indoor bar area this winter, but during this extremely hot summer, it's the roof-top patio all the way. It's got a huge outdoor seating area, comfortable and modern red-and-black-cushioned patio furniture and back-lit bar that looks very Miami as the sun goes down. The chill-out music sounding from the speakers adds to that 'sit-here-and-chillax-for-as-long-as-you-want' vibe.\n\nPrices are a bit steep for this area (like I said, think King West!) but the staff is super-attentive and the food portions are a good size.  They've got some creative sushi rolls (try the Canadian, wrapped in bacon) and tasty tempura appetizers. It would be great if you could order Fran's brunch on the rooftop patio on a Saturday or Sunday morning...I hope that is in the works!\n\nThe lounge is pretty new, so it was quiet, but I can see it picking up once word gets around.

The BBQ had been sitting under a warmer far too long, and I wasn't really clear on the seafood\/BBQ connection.

AVOID ANY OF THE FRIED ITEMS on the menu since it's pretty obvious they never change their cooking oil and everything tastes the same-- terrible-- and is WAY over-cooked. Their fries, cajun or otherwise, are like eating a mouthful of table salt. Awful! Stick with the bags and corn and you'll be OK. \n\nThere's really nothing special about the place that would recommend it over other similarly-themed sports bars in the area, and the manager could use a visit from Jake Tapper at Bar Rescue.

Marche Bacchus is my favorite place to go in Vegas for a brunch that makes me forget I live in the Mojave dessert.  Also, the restaurant offers both their brunch and lunch menu at this time, which offer many more authentic choices than just their dinner menu.\n\nIf it's spring in Vegas, I order the Moules Frites, mussels in white wine butter sauce with crusty baguette, a light and delicious classic that Marche does well; don't forget the Mimosa.  \n\nIf it's summer, I order the lobster avocado croissant, pair it with a Riesling from the market; the sweetness of the Riesling highlights the lobster and brings out the richness of the avocado.  \n\nIf it's fall, I order the duck confit & fettucini pasta, it's a calorie splurge but completely worth it.  \n\nAnd if it's winter, I get the Les Oeufs En Meurette, three perfect poached eggs in hearty red wine sauce with ham and mushrooms; it's a dish that warms your stomach, and your heart; break some rules and order a glass of Cotes Du Rhone with it: red wine works for daytime when it's Vegas harsh dry winter.\n\nDessert is their weakness.

A simple enough order, or so I thought.  How bad could it be, you're thinking?    Let me tell you:  undercooked eggs with bright yellow, hard jelly-like yolks, chopped in HUGE chunks with an enormous amount of tasteless, gooey mayonnaise on a Montreal sesame seed bagel (the bagel was good).  \n\nSalt, pepper or any kind of seasoning never saw that 'egg salad'.  It was served with potato chips and a side order of POTATO SALAD??  and a pickle.   Talk about a starch redundancy!

At first, I was really turned off by the \"tex-mex\" concept and even the name \"Mesa Grill\" didn't sound too appetizing, but we took a risk... and Bobby delivered.  We came here for my husband's 27th birthday and he had a wonderful time.\n\nSERVICE: \n5 Solid Stars!  The hostesses sat our party right away even though not everyone was there.  We were immediately served water and asked if we wanted any cocktails.  I really loved our waiter.  He wasn't just polite and attentive, but he was also engaging us in wonderful conversation throughout our meal.  He talked to us about how long he had been working there, and what Bobby's like... and he knew the menu like the back of his hand.  It was like having a new friend dine with us throughout the duration of our meal.  I wish I caught his name so I can give him props!\n\nFOOD:\nBread Basket - 2 stars.  They start you off with a variety of breads.  There was a jalapeno one, another one with some blue corn in it, and a third one that I can't recall.  All were very unique, but unfortunately, I wasn't a fan.  I didn't think the bread was very soft or moist, and the flavors didn't do it for me.  Kudos for thinking outside the box though.  The butter also wasn't the soft, spreadable kind.\n\nBlue Corn Pancake - 5 stars.  This appetizer came highly recommended by our server.  There was barbecued duck inside pancake (like a glorified taco), and a habanero chili star-anise sauce drizzled all over it.  The flavors all worked so well together to deliver an explosion of flavors in my mouth.\n\nSpanish Chorizo Quesadilla - 4 stars.  This was larger than expected!  It is pretty filling and could easily be substituted for a meal as a filler.  Or you can split this between 2-3 people and share it as an appetizer.  It's a pretty heavy dish and hard to eat too much of.  There's a large fried egg on top of a tortilla.  Embedded in the tortilla is smoked tomato salsa, grilled green onion, and crispy artichokes.  \n\nFor our entree, my husband and I shared the New Mexican Spice-Rubbed Pork Tenderloin even though I was realllly eyeing the 22 ounce bone-in Ribeye.  The waiter said the pork tenderloin was their signature dish so that's why we ordered it even though I'm not a huge fan of pork.  It wasn't until the dish arrived that we were convinced we had made the right choice!!  WOW, that was one tender, delicious, savory, melt-in-your-mouth piece of meat.  The spice rub added a bit of heat, and I can easily say this is the best piece of pork I've ever been served.  It came with a side of the most amazing tamale.  I can't even begin to describe how good it was.  You just have to try it.  5 Stars for this entire dish!!!\n\nI sampled some of the other dishes from my friends, but the pork dish was the definite standout.  My friend ordered the lamb chops, but they tasted a bit gamey and weren't as tender as they could've been.  The pan seared Halibut was tender and flaky paired with a lovely curry spice reduction.  I'd give both these dishes 4 stars.  \n\nAll in all a wonderful experience.  Glad I finally got to try one of Bobby's restaurants!","date":"2010-07-07 19:41:57"}

His emblazoned name means some tasty meats, let me tell you.   But this restaurant has done nothing for Mr. Flay's Southwestern recipes.  \n\nA friend and I had lunch at MESA today, and before I get into the gory details, let me say the wait staff and bus service was very great.  Helpful on all sorts of problems;   for instance, there was a bug that crawled out of my friend's salad, stretched its little bug legs, and sat around for a minute while we waved down the help. \n\n  We assumed the bug had been knocked senseless by the over-seasoning of the lamb in the Cobb salad.  And over-seasoning is ridiculous here!   My pork tenderloin sandwich with Southwestern fries was like being double-teamed by rubs and seasoning salt.  Now the tenderloin was tender, but like my friend's lamb, there was no tasting of anything but chilis. \n\n  Without like an aioli or some kind of dill yogurt to give your mouth a rest, it all just blends into generic spice tastes.    Adding in the heavyness of the dishes such as the recommended goat cheese queso fundido (Which was very delicious, but served with generic and easily breaking nachos)  you are left queazy and overfilled.\n\n20 minutes after our meal, on which the salad was comped and we were given free creme brulees (chocolate toffee, so rich and creamy), I began to feel very ill.   I ended up doubled-over in a forums restroom, the final and worst part of it all.\n\nI think of it as a science experiment, and sometimes science produces great things.  Sometimes you irradiate yourself.  This was more of the latter.   A lot of nice little things, such as the help and appetizers, but outweighed by a couple unforgivable offenses.   I also don't like a meal so poorly spiced that it causes my body to actually reject it.  \n\nSorry Bobby, maybe you should return and retune.","date":"2010-08-20 22:26:25"}

I called a month or so later to order contacts and was told I could not pay for the contacts when I came and picked them up; I needed to pay for them over the phone. I have never paid for contacts before picking them up before but I figured it wasn't a big deal, just differences between offices. Once I got the statement for my order, I realized that they had charged me the full amount and not run anything through my insurance company. I called back and was met with no answers, saying they would call me back later. They never did, so I called back again and finally learned that my vision insurance had never been added to my file. After going through my information a second time, they then assured me they would file a claim with my insurance company and I would receive a check soon. Never once in this back and forth did anyone from the staff apologize or recognize that they had made a mistake. In fact, everyone I talked to seemed more agitated that they now had to reprocess the claim. A month later, I received my refund along with an updated billing statement. Amongst the revised patient\/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary. It read: \"patient originally did not say to use insurance and paid in full for contacts-decided a few days later she would like us to bill vsp and refund her the remaining balance\". This is the first medical establishment I have come in contact with that required me to advise them of my desire to use my medical insurance. Professional medical establishments run benefit checks and inform the customer of their costs prior to performing the service. While I feel Dr. Strain is a highly qualified ophthalmologist, I am exceedingly disappointed in the professionalism and efficiency of the office staff. At this point, I do not see myself returning in the future.","date":"2018-04-04 00:37:04"}

The Abbey seemed to fulfill all necessary criteria.  The criteria being: patio, beer and tasty food.  \nWell, it had two of the three, however, those two were not enough to redeem this place, especially in light of the laughably awful service.\nNow, I'll admit that three of the people in our party got their food and enjoyed it.  However, two of us were not so lucky.  \nFirst we were given the wrong food.  The one other person who ordered at the same time as us (we sort of ordered in two shifts) got his food.  They took back our messed up orders, with the excuse that the computer wasn't working and thus the orders were messed up...uh okay.  Twenty minutes later we recieved the food we ordered, just as our friend was finishing his meal.  Unfortunately, my greek salad came topped with fetid feta cheese and the caesar wrap came complete with bugs squished on the lettuce.  \nThe good news was that the food was comped.  However, it took us a little too long to pay as the debit machine phone line was being used by a disgruntled employee to complain about her employment situation and to utter expletives in that regard.\nNeedless to say we won't go back.  There are too many awesome restaurants and patios to waste any more time there.  \nWe did enjoy the beautiful sunshine though : )","date":"2009-05-20 13:47:18"}

Everything from Vanilla Cinnamon to Cotton Candy. And of course to celebrate the holidays, they also have Egg Nog and Pumpkin Flavours. Oh, and did I mention that you get to choose mixins?!?!? So not ONLY do you get to pick the flavour of ice cream you want, but you get to pick the mixins you want mixed in. We're talkin anything from chocolate bar pieces, to fresh fruit. So it's basically like a blizzard or a Yogen Fruz but in a cone, and with the freshest, most delicious ice cream you can imagine. Once you've picked your ice cream flavour and your mixins, they mash everything up right in front of you on a frozen counter. Then once it's all perfectly mixed, they scoop it into a cone (or a cup of you prefer) and you're good to go.\n\nI haven't even mentioned yet that they also sell cakes, take-home pints, shakes, floats, smoothies and frozen yogurt.\n\nI know, RIGHT?!?!??!\n\nIf you hadn't guessed it already, I'm definitely a fan.

The young lady who did my pedicure was very sweet, attentive and friendly. However, I was supposed to get a manicure as well and what I got was, well...half of that.(hence the 1\/2 star) while getting my pedicure, another young lady came over and grabbed my hand and pulled out the small shelf.

I assume she will perform the \"actual\" manicure, She doesn't. No massage no cuticle oil no trimming or pushing back of cuticles...I had decided to try the SNS dipping powder and she just jumped right in, proceeded to file my nails and apply the powder. She was very nice as well and very funny as was Danny who was beside us performing color application on another client. The nail tech finished my SNS but the top coat was taking too long to dry and was dull looking. Danny ended up fanning my nails by hand to help them dry then finally had the first girl (who walked away from me) to remove the top coat and apply a gel coat instead and use the UV light to dry it. All in All The finished product looks pretty good, however I've determined that I am not a fan of the SNS powder as it looks thick on my natural nails as if I have chunky acrylic nails and I've never been a fan of those...not their fault, just not my cup of tea but for $70 (plus $15 tip) I should have gotten a complete Manicure.

Therefore all the mediocre reviews below should take into account that this property is in transition.  I first stayed here back in the 80's and gradually watched it deteriorate.  So its current condition is great in comparison.   The rooms no longer look like photos 11 and 12 posted above. The rest are up to date.\n\n* Positives:  Flat screen TV's on wood laminate TV walls, furniture has been updated since the photos posted, IKEA lighting, temperature controls in each room (but older units), very clean and loved the wood flooring over nasty hotel carpeting.  The current internet rate is $72\/night.  How can you beat that in a central Toronto location? I like that you need to use your room key to move the elevator. This stops strangers from accessing the upper floors as the desk can't see the elevators.  There is a security guard on at night.  A concierge will also be located in the lobby in the future. \n\n* Negatives:  The awful drapery and the bathroom still needs some improvement.  The room is small but no different than any other budget hotel.  The lobby and restaurant are being renovated so you have to deal with that.  Paying $10 a day for wireless is a bit too much.\n\nI would stay here again.  Another plus, the Airport Express bus stops right at the door taking you to Pearson aiport for $20 (or $18 online).","date":"2010-01-08 02:38:45"}

This was a pre-opening tasting, so they're still working on all of the fine points.  Nonetheless, it is a terrific spot.  The structure itself is very appealing, as they restored a 1940's-era building and exposed its beautiful brickwork, which is complimented with a stained concrete floor.  The bar is a proper one with a wide array of liquors and fairly ample seating for the size of the space.  The patio definitely will be the preferred seating choice so long as the weather cooperates.  We tried macaroni and cheese as well as the cole slaw starters; for $3 each, you could make a delicious, reasonably-priced meal from a collection of the starters.  The double dip starter (cobb dip and posole salsa with chips) was very good, though I almost preferred the dip and salsa without the chips because they're so flavorful.  The mixed grain salad was a good choice, too, though I might try to find something other than the orange vinagrette to put on it.  The wine on tap was tasty, and they'll also have a small list of about 8 bottles.  Again, the official opening isn't until the 25th, so they're still honing the fine edges.

Boy was I mistaken.  The parking lot was jammed and therefore forced to eat in the lounge without a reservation.  In the end, probably a better choice.  The lounge, though seperate, actually shares the main dining room's huge picture window view of the heavily forested ravine and Cahoon Creek.  The rustic decorating and dark tones with a glowing fireplace makes you think you might be in a roaring 20's hideaway.  The bartender was a pro - courteous, efficient, \"healthy\" drink pourer.  The lounge menu struck us as pricey at first but fears were quelled when our neighbor's order arrived.  We opted for the steak sandwiches which came with potato or salad. Prepared perfectly and just enough to satisfy. We felt very good about our choices all around.  I was taken by the sheer number of people and traffic when compared to the prices, Cleveland economy and aforementioned new options.

Tonight on our way back from the hospital and being Labour Day we thought we would call them to see if they were open. So I got Siri going and got the number. I dialed it and asked if they were open. The lady on the phone said that they were very busy and that I should make a reservation. I did and off we went. When we got there the first clue that something was amiss was that the place was nearly deserted and they could not find my reservation. We took our seat and proceeded to order. Not five minutes into this and we get a call from a local number, it was the first restaurant we called wondering where we were. As it turns out the owners of Cynthia's created a tangent restaurant called Cynthia's Paradise and put it literally right next door. Talk about confusing your market. Given the way the night was going to unfurl we should have packed up and gone next door.\n\nI ordered the Hot and Sour Soup to start. This is one of my favourites and when I looked at the $4.95 price tag I assumed we were going to get a bowl big enough to share. When it came I got this little golden globe before me which revealed inside an even smaller ceramic bowl which if it held 1 cup of soup I would have been amazed. The soup was adequate. It has a nice balance of all the flavours I am used to but in no way was this worth 5 dollars. I mean for just one dollar more at another chinese restaurant I got a bowl of soup so large that it would have filled that little bowl before me 20 times over. What really drove the point home though was the little tiny $3.50 Egg Roll and the 2 HarGow for $4.50. This place was way over priced. So maybe the service was going to be exceptional. I mean, there were more people on the floor, behind the counter and that could be seen in the kitchen than there were patrons sitting at the tables. The 2 HarGow came one at a time in the tiniest steam boxes I have ever seen. We ordered Moo Shu Pork, Chinese Broccoli and the House Special Fried Rice. The food took way longer to get to us than was comfortable for me but taste wise it was very good. Far too expensive but very good. Ended the meal with the Deep Fried Creme Brulee and with a 13% tip the meal came out to $94.75.\n\nFrankly I can think of a number of places that I would like to spend that kind of money for 2 people. Cynthia's Chinese Restaurant is no longer one of those. As a comparison the meal at Cynthia's Paradise would have cost $54 for two people all you can eat. I will do a review of Paradise when I go there but this place will never see another dime from me.","date":"2016-09-06 02:10:35"}

It was yesterday, a day with freezing rain. When I called in and made reservation in the Morning, I didn't think it'd be a full house on a day like this( April snow). I'm so glad that I did when I arrived this hidden gem in a not so busy neighbourhood. \n\nWe ordered cheese Jalapeño for starter, osso buco and braised lamb for main. Everything was delicious!!!! So richly infused with all kinds of spices! The cheese jalapeño looks a little unpleasant under the red neon light, but after the first bite, we are totally sold!! Both osso buco and braised lamb come with tostadas and beans and rice, no need to order separately. The portion was quite generous for two girls, next time we will probably cut one main and do one more starter. \n\nMy only criticism would be the size of the table. For Mexican food, it'd be great if we have a little bigger table for the many dishes. But I understand that it is built upon a small townhouse, won't be able to have so many people if the table is bigger. \n\nAdvise before going: \n\n1,it's going to be fully packed, make your reservation early. \n2, it's going to be loud, don't expect to sit in a quite corner. \n3, ask the waiter for recommendation, they give great tips!","date":"2018-04-15 14:42:51"}

Their room service isn't insanely over priced like most Vegas hotels, but there's a reason for that, everything tastes like it had been made 24-48 hours earlier.\n\nLastly and most importantly, after surviving 3 nights in this dump, I was brushing my teeth the following morning when I noticed a fairly large cockroach scamper across the sink.\n\nAfter all this I literally slept at my friends hotel the final night to avoid puking in my own mouth or getting some rare form of malaria.\n\nIf I told you how much I paid to stay at this sh*thole, you would kick me in the d*ck for being such a dumbass. \n\nIn the end I feel like I got raped for my hard earned cash just so I could save a little.

In fact just thinking about Savoy makes my mouth water a little, that's how much I love Savoy.\n\nThe first time I sampled some bites from Savoy was at a Yelp event last year; unfortunately it took me quite a long time to make my way back, but I after the meal I had last week I think the wait was worth it. I went here for dinner with a family member on a Wednesday night - as a result the place was pretty quiet when we arrived. After checking our coats (this is more or less mandatory as they don't let you drape them over the chairs) we were seated at one of their comfy downstairs lounge tables, and we explored the menu, ordered, and proceeded to enjoy an excellent meal.\n\nFirstly, there was the fresh free bread with oil and balsamic for dipping. I was quite hungry so this was a great start. One note, though - beware the spicy bread! We're pretty sure jalapenos were baked into a couple pieces. Tasty for some, not ideal for people like me though.\n\nThen there was the drinks. My dining companion ordered a blackberry Cosmo (made with ingredients like blackberry moonshine - quite a nice touch), and I ordered the Starburst. Both of these drinks were superb; the Cosmo was a first-rate drink and oddly enough, my Starburst did indeed remind me of Starburst candies - but was still muuuuch tastier!\n\nAs for the food - just, YUM! My companion ordered tomato soup and a pear salad. The salad was flavorful (though pretty standard in terms of salad ingredients), and the tomato soup was simply amazing - in addition to its freshness and being the perfect thickness it came with grilled cheese sandwich squares instead of croutons. More restaurants need to do this with their tomato soup, it was just so good! As for me, I ordered the 2015 restaurant week special - hen with bacon mac and cheese and a side of kale - and this was simply divine. I have yet to find such tender, juicy and well seasoned chicken in the city, plus the mac and cheese wasn't overly cheesy and had the bacon flavor infused into it. The result was that it wasn't too rich and it went well with my chicken and kale. The entire meal was also served with a side of tomato gravy, which was basically a thicker version of the tomato soup I'd sampled and fallen in love with already. I couldn't have been happier with what I ordered.\n\nThe clincher for our excellent meal was the fantastic service we received throughout the night. All in all we thought Savoy had amazing food, fantastic staff and a very chill but warm atmosphere. We would absolutely come back - hopefully my next meal here will involve sampling the amazing looking brunch menu!","date":"2015-01-18 18:49:53"}

I just purchased a 2011 Chevrolet Malibu from this dealership, and I went here after work to pick up the green slip so I can register the car with the DMV. \nTIP: Customers who buy or lease vehicles here: DO NOT have to go to the DMV to register your vehicle. You simply use the dealerships control number on the green slip to enter in the DMV website and it will bring up the vehicle you bought. You can then transfer or request new plates (standard only plates) and the DMV will mail them to you. This is handy, because we ALL hate the DMV. \n\nBack to my review of AutoNation Buick GMC of West Sahara round 2. So I got the green slip and I was \"just looking\" at some of the Buicks on the lot. Buick has come along way in the last 10 years or so. This is NOT your grandfather's or grandmother's Buick anymore. I had a 2013 LEXUS ES 300h that got 39MPG highway and 40MPG city. It had quite a few bells and wistles. Anyway, I began by driving a V6 powered 2016 Buick Lacrosse and Devon and Denzell were my points of contact again. I really liked it. This one didn't have the same equipment that my Lexus does, so I didn't really want this particular car, as I didn't want to go down in car quality or caliber. Then I drove a 2014 Chevrolet Impala V6, and loaded with everything for that model year with 22k miles and they were asking 25k for it. I really liked this car. It wasn't a Lexus or a Buick, but it was cheaper than either one of those and it was fully loaded. But I was contemplating replacing my business car, which was my Lexus, and I already had a V6 powered Malibu that I bought for 16k with 32.5k miles two weeks earlier from this same dealership, and the same sales people (Devin and Denzell). It took me forever to decide even after driving a brand new 2015 Buick Lacrosse that had just about everything my Lexus did minus the front parking sensors and the dash cam, but I can replace the dash cam later (which I will at this dealership for both my Malibu and Lacrosse). I got a Heads Up display system with forward collision alert, I got a Bose audio system, a panoramic sun roof, remote starter system, and a wifi hotspot powered by onstar. These features my Lexus didn't have. \n\nI was given multiple options, and a lot of time to decide which vehicle I wanted out of the three, the Chevrolet Impala, or the 2015 V4 eAssist Buick or the 2016 V6 Buick. I ultimately chose the 2015 eAssist V4 Buick Lacrosse based upon what I was going to be doing with the car, showing Real Estate. I was offered an unbelieveable deal too. Because this vehicle was a 2015, and was sitting in the showroom, and the 2016's were already here and more were coming, this car was priced at 35k. Originally it was 41k which was understandable. If I bought my Lexus ES 300h brand new, it would have been 47k easy. I know cars, and how to shop for the ones I like or want. So I knew I was getting a deal on this new car. Also, I was given a 2k tax credit for my Lexus, and AutoNation gave me another $800.00 off on the car, because I am a repeat buyer, and I didn't waste anyone's time. Thank you David! \n\nSo I still had 1k of negative equity to deal with, and that was done by lowering my interest rate from 4.9% with Lexus to 3.9% through AutoNation Buick GMC's contacts. Can you say Credit Unions anyone? If you want great financing go see the fine people at AutoNation Buick GMC, they WILL find you a good deal, if it takes all day. They don't just use traditional banks or manufacturer banks like most dealerships do, which all charge higher interest rates, trust me I've been there. \n\nSo in combination of lowering the interest rate again to 3.45%, and further dropping the price of the new 2015 Buick Lacrosse, I wrapped up my negative equity and came UP about 2k. This shows in the contract as down payment money which is true because I verified how the dealership got the numbers. So I got a brand new Buick Lacrosse, with an extended warranty, prepaid oil changes for 3 years on top of the 2 years given to you by GM (General Motors), theft protection and GAP insurance and my payments are $616.00 per month versus $647.00 a month with Lexus without the theft protection, or the prepaid maintance plans. Lexus doesn't offer standard oil changes for the first 2 years either. \n\nWhat's more, my Buicks engine, transmission, and final point of assembly are in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Just like my 2011 Chevrolet Malibu. The major components of these cars are made here. Just read the window sticker, it will tell you where the major components are made. We need jobs in this country badly. I don't need Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump to \"bring back the jobs\" to the United States. We can all do our part by giving GM, Ford or even Fiat Chrysler a chance. Personally, I am a GM man. I loved my Lexus, but I love my country, my Buick, and the sales team at AutoNation Buick GMC even more. They also hire the veterans! Thank you again everyone @ AutoNation!","date":"2016-04-11 18:23:24"}

Appetizers were Mac and cheese triangles...absolutely the greasiest, worst tasting item I've ever put in my mouth at a restaurant. Potato skins were very dry...no flavour at all.\nSome of us ordered the wing dinner, which was wings, fries and a soft drink (no refills). The fries came out as an appetizer...not with the wings. They were basic fries and pretty flavourless.\nWhen our food came out, it came out at different times. 2 people got their order (one was a wing dinner and the other a burger dinner) while a 3rd was returned because the person who brought out the wings could not tell us which type of wings they were. She said she would be right back with them, but she answered a phone and talked on it for an awfully long time. 10 minutes later, those wings were brought back out, with the other 3 wing orders. WTF?\nWings were a huge disappointment. While meaty, they were sprinkled with minimal sauce....no  flavour at all.

When I called to dispute the error, I spoke with Lian Santon.  At first she told me the charge was because the company undercharged me for the vehicle.

After being placed on hold for a while, she told me the fee was for fuel, yet I brought the vehicle back on full.  After being placed on hold for over 30 min, she told me that they would only be able to credit back $8 and not the full $11.52 because the other $3.52 was included in taxes.  Another representative called back to tell me that the company would have to call the car rental location and verify that the car was brought back on full before I could receive the other $3.52.

Like life or death people.\n\nWHAT I GOT: Cheese ribs\n\nPROS: Repeat after me. You can NEVER go wrong with meat and cheese. EVER. And my goodness, James Cheese Back Ribs is winning the restaurant game. You get a pool of gooey cheese that the server wraps around each rib along with extra corn, two different mashes (sweet potato and regular potato), mini sausages, and scrambled eggs. The ribs themselves were coated in this beautiful and super flavorful sauce, and the meat was super tender as well. Literally fell off the bone with one bite. They also give you scissors and some plastic gloves to keep your hands clean, along with the option to choose the heat level of your ribs. We went with mild, which honestly is not spicy at all, so if you're looking for even a little bit of a kick, I would suggest the regular spicy option.\n\nCONS: Ok well the price is pretty hefty. Not gonna lie. And the sides aren't exactly the most tasty things ever but combined with the cheese, usually anything will taste good. But be warned, the server will turn off the gas stove that melts the cheese once all the ribs are wrapped so the cheese will start to get hard again. If you wanna dip your sides, eat those first. And the ribs are a bit on the small side so this meal won't actually fill you up, if that's what you're looking for.","date":"2017-10-02 02:17:24"}

The original bibimbap was yummy (nothing extraordinary but solid and at least normal portion size).  The chocolate lava cake was delicious.  Warm and gooey. \n\nThe not so good: side dishes were icky.  So sad because half the fun of Korean food are the yummy side dishes.  The seafood pancake was tiny and for $9.50, so not worth it.   We are normally huge fans of seafood pancake but just so tiny here (two small silver dollar pancake size ones and at most places you get one the size of a dinner plate).   The pork belly app was so so.  \n\nOur waitress was really nice though it took a while to get seated and for someone to come and take our order.  \n\nOverall: small portions, pretty good service...

PEKING MAN in large, faux-Asian font on a bright red back drop. That's definitely a holdover from the 70s or 80s. After struggling to find an actual entrance (you see, it may be listed as being on Sheppard, but you have to turn on Ambrose to actually get to the storefront. If you're heading east and miss Ambrose, there's no chance to U-turn til Leslie, unless you want to run over city-owned flowers in the median.), we finally parked the car in front of some convenience store in the same strip mall\/mini-industrial park building area. Given the PEKING MAN sign is all you can see from the main road, I don't know how other businesses can persist here. \n\nThe moment we went past the doors, we were greeted with a motorcycle arcade machine. What is this, Chuck E. Chan? Ah ha, ha., there's a Chuck E. Cheese down the road. A waitress came up and we were promptly seated and presented with these ghastly menus, with cartoon depictions of, presumably, a Peking man in various states of labour (labour as in work, not Chinamen giving birth!).\n\nOn to the food! A family of five orders the following for dinner: Bamboo and Dried Scallop Soup, Deep-fried Soft Shell Crab, Peking Duck Special, Lobster fried in salt and pepper, and Shanghai Noodles with beef. I'll spare you the details, because there are no details. It was all bland. It was as if everything was frozen for Walt Disney's first meal after being brought back to life from his cryogenic sleep. The soup wasn't watered down, but it tasted like it was. The crab and the lobster were fried in the same tasteless junk probably used to grease door hinges. The duck was somewhat of a saving grace. First course, slightly crispy duck skin (though not nearly crispy enough to my liking), with fine slices of duck meat, to be wrapped in rice paper. Spare yourself from attack of the living bland and eat the duck straight up without the wrapping. Second course, stir-fried duck meat. More meh. Basically, anything these guys actually cook gets turned from gold into lead.\n\nAriel G. may want to take that trip down memory lane, but this meal was a memory I'd rather repress.","date":"2009-10-14 05:44:40"}

EXTREME pain right now. Got a Saturday ( today visit). I told the front desk BEFORE I went back that I didn't get paid until Wednesday ( a few days), and that I just paid to fix my roof so money is tight. After being examined and X rayed they explained what they could do and that my portion would be $160. They weren't sure they could even help m today as Phan's schedule was tight. I told them I could only pay $100 today. I was told by their office manager they don't do payment plans , they could try and get me some dental credit plan. I told them I didn't want to do that. It was $160 today or nothing. I told them I was unable to do that. So I came in pain , left in pain- they did nothing for me - I offered to pay my bill (around $60) as I left. They wanted to bill my insurance etc but I didn't want to hear from them again so I insisted I pay it all now because I wanted nothing to do with them ( contact me after insurance etc). . I complained  and to shut me up they wiped the bill clean. \n\nThey are all about the money. My $100 today plus insurance ( and $60 in 3 business days) wasn't enough to help me. Forget about helping me because I was in pain - they did nothing - nothing - they wouldn't even do it for 2\/3 my portion today , the rest in a few days ( as well as gouging my  insurance) \n\nTHEY ARE ALL ABOUT THE MONEY. They don't care if you hurt. They are very high tech - and I understand they need to pay off all their high tech equipment - \n\nMy opinion : Pham sucks! Palo verde dental sucks!  \n\nCame in pain , left in pain - they use your pain to extort money from you. It's just white collar crime - they knew exactly my finances before I even went to a room , and then after exam it was \"pay up or get out\" - the officer manager specifically said \"we do not do payment plans\". \n\nThey wasted my one day off when I could have found someone who would help me when I am in severe pain \n\n\n===== \n\nAddendum 7\/1\/16 \n\nYep ...

There may have been other stuff between the broiche slices, I just don't remember.   To fill, I mean really fill up the rest of the plate, a huge mound of thinly sliced fries.  I would have liked the fries to be a little more crispy.  The sandwich was good.  Even though it looked small, it was a lot of food.  \n\nCorned Beef Hash was just how I liked it.  Corned in small cubes, potatoes about the same size.  Peppers and onions.  with your style of egg on top.  This is how, I think corned beef should be served.  5 stars for this meal.\n\nHam and eggs were just ham and eggs, with some scallopped potatoes.  Nothing special about this meal.

I haven't been during happy hour, as it seems the place is bursting at the seems waiting for a Fire Marshall to be called. It might be best to go during that hour or so if you're trying to have more than one beverage at this place. \n\nAnyways, it's a dueling piano bar with two fella's who know all the bangin' hits from the 50's all the way up to today's Top 40. A patron can request a song (once one ends and \/ or hasn't been interrupted) and if someone in the crowd isn't pleased - he or she then has the opportunity to walk up to the the non-playing pianist, offer a cash tip of higher cash value than that placed prior and have the song changed on the spot.. keeping both the patrons and musicians on their toes. It's really an interactive environment - in the sense that the pianists continuously receive requests, talk to the crowd, with the crowd itself shootin' the breeze, minglin', singing and dancing if they know the jam being performed. If you can't see the performers, they have tv's lined up throughout the bar so you can catch a glimpse. I'm not the tallest human, so it's often I end up in somebody's armpit while they're singing their favorite track and I'm gasping for air. Kidding, I'm actually the guy who has YOU in the headlock; You'll be blissfully swept away by my beautiful renditions of Bohemian Rhapsody, I Want You To Want Me & my jam - One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer in an overtly joyous manner. \n\n*They also have that lady you see at all the shows.. she dances & looks like Dee from It's Always Sunny, tries to get you to boogey with her and you can't understand what she's saying, though, she sings every song on cue without a slur.  She's an interesting human who needs help, so you push her towards the random person next to you hoping they'll do something about it. Do some people observing and find em'! \n\nThis is a place of action, sound and movement. You might get bumped or pulled to dance and sing.

I bought 2 Groupons and waited two weeks to get my pre-paid for appointment (1 set for one house 2nd set for another). #1 was scheduled for a Thurs-Fri two weeks later and house #2 the third Thurs-Fri. I got a call from Jimmy on Mon-Tues of the Thurs before House #1 was to be completed putting me off another  week (now we're in week 3).  I had two potential buyers come by that weekend to see house #1. They went with the other house on my block because of my ugly brown paint (that I had scheduled to be done)!\n\nFinally my long-awaited for Thursday came and Jimmy showed up with two men promptly at 7:00 and gave me the trip charge, charge for baseboards, and for an extra room.  It was VERY fair.  The men did a good job... maybe an 8-9 and cleaned up well.  They had to schedule my 2nd house for Saturday (I had told Jimmy I'd need 4 full days - two for each house). He did not come out to give the men direction for house #2 on Saturday or give me the price of things the groupon didn't cover  (I had high ceilings in both houses and needed an extra room done, wall paper removed from one small wall, etc.)  \n\nHe finally came out Monday around Noon to quote prices on #2 (again reasonable) but his men were upset that he hadn't shown up either morning to give them direction.  Plus the men had some conflicts with my handyman.  The men disappeared Mon around 12:30 - they got back at 2:30ish and left by 3:30 with the RR undone and wallpaper stuck on the tub and counters (from the removal) of my bathroom. The baseboards were done poorly, paint dripping was all over the tub, counters and floors and 2nd coat was never completed.  \n\nJimmy told me that he'd come finish the job - said I was getting the \"best of the best.\"  Because I wanted a slight color alteration (lighter) in the RR, he told me there would be a charge and a small charge for one other wall.  Once the paint had dried, I realized that Jimmy had not cut in the new color or cleaned up the wall paper and paint drippings from his men. He also didn't redo the messy baseboards.  My handymen and I were shocked by Jimmy's paint job (drips, no cutting in, unfinished baseboards). Then Jimmy called and asked me to have my handymen bring him his forgotten ladder??? What?\n\nBotton line... Groupons appear to be LAST priority for timing and you'll be paying weeks before you get the work.  They may also send you new, untested employees (my two workers told me I was their first project with Jimmy).","date":"2015-08-19 05:17:03"}

The goat cheese queso fundido was better than \"just fine.\"  The chile relleno and the tiger shrimp were both spectacularly good - snapping with unique flavors.

The korma sauce is a bit sweeter than I'd prefer, but the Pratak was impressively good.  Like the other reviewers pointed out, the Naan leaves something to be desired - it's blah, at best.  \n\nIt's a good value too, you can get in and out with 2 dishes for about $8.  \n\nHam it up with the owner and what appears to be his wife.  Super nice guy who likes to chat and appreciates a decent joke.  Actually got an extra scoop of Chicken Pratak for getting him to laugh, I'm certain of it!","date":"2012-12-04 17:52:37"}

We had the gyro plate which was unlike American gyros with pita, but instead was served with a fresh Greek salad and lemon potatoes. We also got the lamb dinner special which literally fell off the bone because it was so tender. And we also got a sort of Greek lasagna with a rich white bechamel sauce. The service was super friendly and very attentive. We got to see the kitchen and saw everything that the chef prepared for the days specials which only made our mouths water more than they already were. Prices were very affordable as well.

Their outdoor patio is delightful on warm summer evenings, and the inside, while dimly lit and a bit hipster-y, nevertheless feels welcoming and cozy. The menu is written with a heavy dose of sass and snark, which makes it a fun read. Who wants to order boring old chicken tenders when you can order \"Britney Spears\"? I should probably look into hiring their menu writer to help me jazz up my tech reports for work.\n\nAnyway, I've ordered many things here, and their food is usually solid. My favorite meal begins with a plate of their \"church basement pierogies.\" They cook up a legit pierogie, with a soft, tender shell browned to perfection and housing a ton of delicious, fluffy, flavorful potato and cheese filling. They are *almost* as good as actual church basement pierogies. Then I like to wash down my pierogies with an order of their mac and cheese topped with blackened chicken. Their mac is addictive -- creamy, rich, cheesy and topped with crunchy breadcrumbs. I really like the blackened chicken paired with the mac, as the spicy cajun seasoning on the chicken cuts through the fattiness of the cheese sauce quite nicely. Supremely delicious. I will admit that once in a blue moon the mac and cheese will be a bit dry, which is a bummer. So the consistency is not 100% there. But nine times out of ten, I'm graced with a good amount of cheese sauce and I'm a happy camper. And then I pass out in a carb-induced coma.\n\nThe downside here is, of course, their prices. They are pretty expensive. I recently got my standard pierogies-and-mac meal for take out after not having visited for awhile, and I had forgotten just how pricey they are (it was $25 + tip for my meal for take out).  So be prepared to have your wallet cry a little, but the mac and cheese should help cheer it up.","date":"2015-04-01 20:26:40"}

I was encouraged to go again,  which I did,  yesterday with a group of 8 people.  To start,  they would not sit us because we only had 6, the other two gals were on their way. The restaurant was pretty empty,  but they stated they had other reservations.  I never saw a group of 8 come,  so. ..our table should have been available anyway.  We would have ordered many more drinks but instead we had one, two at the most.  The guy that finally decided to sit us was not very nice,  and rudely said \"come on! \" to which I responded that we weren't a bunch of cows being herd to our table. He didn't say anything.  Our server was alright,  her voice was a bit much on the ears, have you heard of voice fry? The food,  great, guacamole and queso fundido were tasty. The tacos great as expected, the mijito, though  not on the menu was well done. We came during happy hour,  but when checks came the bill didn't reflect that. The waitress seemed annoyed when we asked about it.  We are by no means a difficult or demanding group. So I am inclined to think it's an attitude issue on their part. I was  completely done with the experience when a plate load crashes on the floor. It falls from the hands of one of servers. It was literally next to us,  soooo loud,  pieces flying,  and not a word to apologize or something!? We weren't offered desert and at that point I was too bothered to stay longer.  I said bye and thank you as I walked out,  but there was no response from the staff.

Let me just narrow down this review to our latest experience (hub's bday - and btw, I know he's not my hubs yet, but it's way easier and a lot less annoying to type, IMO).\n\nSome highlights: the bartenders are so nice and SO talented.

Think about the best part of friend chicken, and then imagine having JUST that on a plate covered in spicy honey sauce. I die.\n\nOn to entrees: you can't go wrong with both styled of fried chicken. I always go for the Tennessee Hot because I like a little bit o' spice and the sauce is killer, but my hubs goes the Umbrian style (your regular run of the mill fried chicken) and it's equally delicious and fall-off-the-bone.\n\nLastly, and truly I'm saving the best for last, dessert: You have two options: you need to either go for the pie or go for the donut...\n\nThe pie is from Pie Snob (if you don't know about Pie Snob, look it up on Yelp RIGHT NOW, and then order an apple pie, and then thank me later).\n\nThe donut and pure caramel heaven.

All teas are blended in house, and they are working on using herbs grown in a community garden in Millvale in some blends! You can even sniff the tea that you want in little jars that are laid out.

Only place in town with a mimosa deal that would take a crowd like us.  You would think that they would maybe tell a couple of extra servers to come in at least for the hour or 2 we were there.  We had 2 servers for our group and they also had other tables.  They did well, but felt I pretty bad for the other tables.\n\nThe brunch menu was large, but mostly it was just slight variations on eggs and meat with some major exceptions.  It was a cheaply made paper menu, but the one thing that stood out \"the hangover\" which was a breakfast sandwich on a doughnut.  But, they don't serve it anymore, even though it was on this cheaply made menu.  I tasted many peoples dishes, they were good but over priced.  Everything was roughly $9 except for biscuits and gravy and french toast.  Although, the $2 mimosa's and $4 bloody mary's is hard to beat.\n\nAll in all, this place has a history that it doesn't live up to.  Its good, but plenty of other places to go.\n\nSide notes:Parking lot sucks, but its made up by the fact that they have SKEEBALL!!!!!!!!!!","date":"2011-02-14 00:21:55"}

We sat at  rooftop bar & service was terrible except for one waitress.

Then, when the food came over (after we asked for it because it took too long) waitress was in a hurry to put down our plates that she spilled all the drinks!  Water & other drinks soaked our clothes, phone, and purse. The waitress ran off quickly to get towels & came to clean up table. Never once asked us or gave us towels to dry...other customers had to until we asked her. Mind you no apology for the spill. The manager even came over to clean up with no apology but rather cracked jokes!  Moved to a new table & she quickly drops off more drinks (on the house) & almost spilled them all on us. Thankfully the new waitress took care of us.  I mentioned our meal should be on the house, when  manager comes over to say they can do the drinks only. After all, it was only water!!  The nerve!!

It is expensive, but not more expensive than the other upscale restaurants in the Palazzo\/Venetian complex.  We also know this is Mr. Keller's \"bistro\" play, it has been much documented.  And I love French bistro food, my favorite kind on earth.  So 2 stars?  Here's why:\n\nService: At these prices you expect excellent service.  We had two tables of 8 each, next to each other, and all I can say is that the service was no better than what you would hope to receive at a Chili's.  Timing was off, smiles were rare, it took forever to deliver a glass of cranberry juice to the one person not drinking wine.  Clean-up was either too early or too late.  Just a mess.  Unacceptable at a restaurant of this rep.\n\nFood:  Yes, pommes frites are a staple of bistros, and Bouchon is known for theirs, but the volume of fries was overwhelming.  At the end of the meal we all sat looking around and laughing at the endless piles of frites that nobody could finish.  I had a flatiron steak, asked for it medium rare, it arrived well done.  I could have sent it back, but given the service I didn't want to chance it, so chewed (and chewed and chewed) it down.  Steak quality was mediocre.  Had a endive\/watercress salad that truly was nothing special.  The walnut vinaigrette did nothing to enhance the bitter endive, think it made it worse.  Ostensibly there was some Roquefort cheese in the salad, but about 4 little nibbles, added nothing to the rest of the salad - disintegrated.  I know times are tight, but this is a double digit priced salad, c'mon.  Nobody raved about their entree, in fact, I think people were expecting something special and kind of stared at what was delivered.\n\nWine:  A pretty fair list, and while not reasonably priced, I've seen more outrageous pricing elsewhere.  But it was predictable, mainly French, with a nice representation from the major regions, but nothing unique or intriguing.  Very safe list.  If this is a bistro there should be some more fun, and less pricey, bistro-y choices like Cru Bourgeois from Bordeaux, a longer list of Provencal wines, some unique choices from Cali.  I could have put this list together in my sleep, and the sommelier and wine service was pretty sleepy and sloppy as well.\n\nI've been here for breakfast\/brunch, and I guess this is their speciality, it was super, a 4 or maybe 5 star breakfast, love that.  But for dinner?  A disappointment.  This restaurant needs an overhaul.","date":"2009-05-21 14:42:13"}

First, let me give you some context:\n\n1. This is not the place to come for authentic Chinese cuisine. Abort mission if that's your goal. Go somewhere with a name that you can barely understand.\n\n2. This is not the place to come for personalized service and attention, especially not at 2am on a weekend. You will be treated like what you probably are - a starving drunk person just as likely to skip out on your bill as you are to vomit on their floor. \n\nSeriously - these folks put up with a lot. A LOT. Can you imagine taking care of hundreds of drunken morons every single night for the entire weekend? It'd be like babysitting 100 children with ADHD who are also carrying loaded pistols and have an undeniable urge to hump on your white tablecloths. So I chose to cut them some slack.\n\n3. I liken this to being the Denny's of Chinese food. It is greasy, unhealthy and oh-so-delicious. You love it while your eating it. You tell yourself it's the greatest meal you've ever had in your life and you want to marry it.\n\nBut in 15 minutes it's going to sit like a stone in your stomach and you will question every ounce of your judgment. If you can survive this brief period of remorse, your overall experience will come out on the positive.\n\n4. On a diet? Yeah, no. Not for you.\n\nYes, I too have been part of the raucous crowd that convenes here late at night after a night out in the Beltline. I have slithered their noodles down my throat and I have savored the juices of their finest ginger beef. I literally can't imagine coming here for a sit down meal at any other time.\n\nI've also come here for the lunch buffet - as take out. The place isn't quite as fun when the disco ball isn't a-glowin'. Now if you're a student, a cheapskate or a person in need of large quantities of food (as much as you can physically force into a styrofoam container) - this place is a great option come lunchtime. Just make sure you bring CASH. They get a bit ornery if you try to pay with Debit\/Credit.\n\nPro tip: Stuff as much as you can into your styrofoam container and just hold it shut, even if it won't close naturally. You might get dirty looks, but I've never been yelled at - yet. Mmmmm, 5 pounds of Calgary's finest imitation Asian cuisine. \n\nIs 4 stars probably pushing it? Yes. If I could I'd give them a 3.5. But as someone else mentioned, Calgary owes these fine folks a bit of thanks for giving us an option other than late night pizza or microwaved Alphaghetti.","date":"2011-11-30 07:11:58"}

(not shampooed, just the seated sprayed off and wiped) We were told to get the $39.00 VIP package, and it would take care of cleaning off the front and back seats. Not only did the wash on the outside look horrible, they barely wiped down the front seats, doors, and dash, they also didnt wipe anything in the back. I had to argue with the manager for almost 10 minutes about wiping down the back, that took him a whole 2 minutes to do, and it was still so half-assed that I had to do it myself once I took the car home. We paid $39 for what would have been the same wash as the $7 was.\n\nI had then taken my car in for detail since I had received a detail job certificate from a friend a couple weeks prior to this fiasco, and being there are no refunds on detail jobs, I had to take it in or lose the money. So, this past weekend, it went in. They took 5 hours to detail the car. I was expecting it to take between 3-4 like they had originally told me, but, that was just the start of the frustration. I paid to have the car detailed with a clay bar to remove swirl marks and find scratches. There are now more swirl marks on my car than when it went in, not all of the wax was removed, so I had to use my microfiber cloths to remove it myself, I specifically said that I DIDNT want any armorall or leather conditioner on my interior, and to just clay bar the outside, they didnt listen to that, so I spent 30 minutes wiping greasy armorall off my interior and leather. I told the manager that I was completely dissatisfied with the job that was done, he refused to give me any money back and said I would have to bring it back for them to do the job again. I will NOT take my car back to have more damage done for another 5 hour job. I could have purchased the stuff to do the job myself in about 2 hours of time and had it done right.\n\nPlease head this warning and DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE! terrible wash, and even worse customer service.","date":"2013-05-07 15:57:59"}

He told me saturday nite he is full. They even had private rooms for conference or weddings etc...Out door on the roof for the summer. Mind blowing. Everything is cook in house.\nI will be back.","date":"2014-04-01 02:39:26"}

One nice perk is that they have an open table that you can stand at to enjoy your pre-dinner drinks so you don't have to crowd around those sitting at the bar. I absolutely love the atmosphere at this place with the big wood-burning pizza oven behind the bar where you can watch your pizza being cooked. They have a great selection of wines from different countries and their food options are not overwhelming, but always deliver big. When I went a couple months ago, they had caramelized brussel sprouts that they cooked in the wood-burning oven that were amazing!! I've tried many of their pizzas and haven't had one that I dislike. My favorites are the Quattro Formaggio and the Spicy Sopressata, which despite the name, is not too spicy. In the summer, a huge perk to this place is their outdoor patio. They have a couple long picnic tables and also have smaller tables along the fence. On a warm spring\/summer night, it's very relaxing to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather.","date":"2014-01-17 16:49:06"}

Check in was reasonable and the staff are friendly. At first I was taken back by the mandatory valet, but I like that it's based on gratuity\/tip. I love that it's smoke free and still basically on the strip. The one bedroom suite is super spacious and could honestly comfortably fit four adults if tight on cash. Rom service provides good portions for the money and is prompt. So the markdowns come for the cleaning and the gym. There were two obvious strains on the curtains, which I know if I can see, housekeeping should be able to and thus CLEAN! Also, I was curious as to why there were a pair of men's dress shoes under the bed. Did housekeeping vacuum under the bed??? Clean with their eyes closed?? I dunno. Also, my friend went to get extra pillows from the closet and said there was hair on them and they were dirty...not acceptable. Lastly, I do workout everywhere and was slightly disappointed from the size of the gym. I was still able to get a mini workout in, but I guess I was expecting more variety and no kids.

If this sort of unabashed adulation makes you uncomfortable, you might want to turn away now. You have been warned. \n\nI HAVE NEVER HAD A BETTER BRUNCH EXPERIENCE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!  The White Brick Kitchen really knows what they're doing and I don't have even one solitary complaint (and, believe me, I'm very picky and thoroughly enjoy complaining when it's warranted - so I would if I could, but I honestly can't).  Allow me to regale you all with the delicious tale of my delightful brunch. \n\nMy friend and I were fearful that we would have to wait for a table when we arrived at 10 am on a Sunday.  It was such a pleasant surprise when we were seated immediately and quickly presented with both coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very welcoming, laid-back and cozy.  I already felt very content as I sipped my OJ, little did I know that I was about to be sky rocketed from content to off-the-charts-euphoric.  It seemed as though we had only just placed our orders for the Scotch-ish Eggs when they were set before us, as if by magic. The service was so fast that it verged on ridiculous, but the quality of the food did not suffer in the least.  On paper, the Scotch-ish Eggs sound super tasty (two panko fried soft boiled eggs, hollandaise, greens, buttered baguette and potatoes), but nothing can fully prepare you for how transcendent this dish truly is.  I am awestruck by how perfectly cooked the soft-boiled eggs were in spite of the fact that they were breaded in panko and deep fried.  I have no idea how they still manage to maintain the optimal runny yolk consistency while creating such a crispy coating on the outside of the egg; it's nothing short of incredible.  Every component of the meal was outstanding - from the dressing with a subtle hint of Parmesan on the salad to the golden brown potatoes.  I can't say enough good things about this dish, you really have to try it!\n\nI'm excited to return to The White Brick Kitchen soon to try their other dishes (if they're anything like the Scotch-ish Eggs, I am definitely in for a treat).  I loved that even though they're offering high-quality food, the prices are very reasonable.  Great spot, great staff and sublime food. You really cannot ask for more!","date":"2013-01-02 18:17:53"}

It was good.  Next out were the onion rings -- about 8-10 rings of various sizes, and Ranch dressing as a dipping sauce.   The onion rings were pretty greasy, as I suppose most are, so I'm not complaining, however I do expect a big stomach-ache from them at any moment -- hopefully I'll be home by then!   I do wish more places would get rid of (more of) the grease before serving onion rings, or set them down atop a diaper or something! \n\nThe pasta course was good.  Instead of them bringing Parmesan cheese on the side, the entree came with it already atop the pasta -- fine for me, but beware, if you don't want cheese.   Also included with the pasta entree were two fresh garlic bread sticks -- they were very handy in absorbing the excess liquid in the bowl of pasta.\n\nI was sad but not surprised to see that instead of deducting a dollar or two off the price of Meatballs & Spaghetti ($8.99) since I asked for pasta & sauce without the meatballs, I was charged full price.\n\nMy bottom line:  Decent food at an OK price & good, friendly service, but neither the casino (I don't gamble) nor the restaurant will be a 'destination' for me -- I came here because I was curious, my curiosity is now satisfied, and I don't see a reason to return.

As in, it is hell. Pure hell.\n\nBelieve you me, I love a good shopping mall as much as the next gal, but I avoid the Eaton Centre like the plague. Oh Eaton Centre, how do I hate thee? Let me count the ways:\n\n1) Teeming with truant teenagers and tired tourists, travelling through the mall itself is a true testament to tenacity. The layout of the centre is confusing, and combined with the constant crowds, navigation can be complicated and challenging (cue applause). \n\n2) It is said that \"variety is the spice of life.\" Consider that the Eaton Centre has 3 Aldos, 2 Bell Worlds, 2 Feet Firsts, 2 Nutrition Houses, and 2 Sunglass Huts, to name a few. Is this really necessary? Is it a secret ploy by the city of Toronto to encourage everyone to be getting proper nutrition while rocking fabulous footwear, sporting sunglasses and chatting on a cell phone? \n\n3) The one redeeming quality of the Eaton Centre - the prime, central location - is also, in several ways, its downfall. Parking is expensive. Hordes of people travelling to and from Dundas and Queen stations and the PATH converge here. Trying to hunt for deals isn't easy when battling major pedestrian traffic.  \n\n4) The washrooms - if you can find one, that is - are always in high demand. High demand washrooms equate to dutty, dutty washrooms.\n\nFor decent mall shopping, Yorkdale is just a hop and a skip away by subway, and is far less congested with pretty much the same (if not better) selection of stores.","date":"2011-05-27 21:08:20"}

I have been on the hunt for the perfect shade of cool ash - trying to shy away from red tones as much as possible. But no matter what salon I visited (mainly in the Durham Region), the colour always ended up having a brassy tinge to it. I set out to find someone who could dye my hair exactly like I wanted. My office recently relocated to King St. E, and I looked for a salon within walking distance - finally landing on McManus and Campbell in the Distillery district. I booked an appointment with Sharon McManus (one of the owners). She listened to my concerns and helped me pick a cool ash tone out of a book of samples. My hair looks amazing, and I can finally say that I am truly happy with the result!\n\nAnd as an added bonus...THEY HAVE A SALON DOG. A sweet black lab named Rita who they rescued from Mexico I believe. She is a sweetheart who roams around the salon looking to be petted and will occasionally sit on your feet as you're getting your hair washed. The prices are also very fair... I have long, thick hair and after tax my full head of colour comes to $90.  \n\nDefinitely worth a visit!","date":"2017-03-27 12:35:46"}

However, when a specialist finally came to me and started to help me to adjust my glasses, the female manager came to talk to the specialist right away and said \"after you get this done, I want you to go to another table.\" She pointed at the table where two white female customers JUST CAME 1 minute ago. That specialist hadn't even started helping me yet and I could sense that he felt awkward, too. He was nice and tried his best to adjust my glasses. During this time, the female manager came twice to our table to rush him go to another table to serve the white ladies. I ignored her and kept talking with the specialist about my glasses. I needed to get my glasses adjusted right since that was the second time to fix this problem. The female manager kept standing 1 meter away from our table and starring at us the whole time. I guess to this female manager, white customers were more important, their time was more valuable and they should not be waiting for a \"long\" time. Therefore she believed that she could rudely and frequently interrupt the service I was receiving and ask the specialist who was helping me to quickly get my part done and to run to help the white customers. If this wasn't her logic, I didn't know what her logic was.\n\nI wouldn't go to Lenscrafters again. Terrible experience.","date":"2018-04-27 23:33:29"}

I ask then about it and (what i assume is the manager) comes over.  He asks me if I was made aware of this by our server. I inform him I don't even know how are server was because we've have at least 4 people serve us. Which is not the norm when we have our usual server serve us. He informs us that hes going to ask the server if she informed us. If she did we would be charged accordingly..if not he would fix it. He finally came back and told us that she had informed us in which we said we would that's impossible. End of story they weren't going to discount us a dollar and we're paying whatever they say because they said so. \nI haven't even mentioned that not once did we get our wine refilled.....and we had to wait 1 hour to get our order fulfilled.

This Historic land mark used to be know as the Cleveland Union Terminal and signs of its history are everywhere. \n\nThis unique center is connected to two hotels (Ritz Carlton & Renaissance) a huge casino (Horseshoe), an 11-screen movie theater, 100 shops, 6 restaurants, and  Cleveland's mass transit system. (RTA). They also have connected walkways to Progressive Field, and Quicken Loans Arena.\n\nThe Skylight Concourse is definitely something to see; this four story (+) tall atrium overlooks the Cuyahoga river hosting a food court and cinema. Here you can grab some stir-fried veggies at Sakkio Japan, Bourbon Chicken at Kelly's Cajun Grill, or just a warm pretzel from Auntie Anne's while enjoying the scenery of  downtown Cleveland and Ohio City.\n\nThe holidays at Cleveland City Center is truly a sight to see. In December they have a 40ft tall Christmas tree with larger than life hanging mechanical ornaments, Gingerbread village, and the best thing ever, the Twigbee Shop! Here you can bring kids under 12 with their shopping list for parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, and uncles and a volunteer helps the little ones buy gifts under $10 that are pre-wrapped. \n\nBesides all the cool shops, you can truly just get lost in this place and enjoy the sights and sounds. Eat, drink, shop, eat, drink, shop... How can you go wrong with that. If all else fails, go blow your shopping money at the casino.\n\nOne of my favorite amenities at City Center is the subway. Cleveland's RTA rumbles below the center giving you the feel a bustling metropolis. Here you can jump the sub and go pretty much anywhere you want in the city, and the mall resembles an oldtyme train station. Just the architecture alone draws me in, I can spend an entire day meandering the halls, people watching, sipping coffee and munching on some delicious treats.\n\nTower City Center is a safe, clean, and fun place to take the kids, watch a movie, or blow your paycheck, just remember to get your parking ticket validated.","date":"2013-10-03 13:18:24"}

We sat outside on a beautiful fall evening, with the sights and sounds of Cleveland's Flats gradually coming back to life. It's a great menu, with lots to choose from. We had the calamari (sauteed, not fried, in a delicious tomato sauce that was perfect for dipping lots of bread in) and the homemade pasta with meatballs. It's the best of comfort food, with enough imagination and elegance to make it special. I had a delicious easy glass of pinot noir and my boyfriend had a gin martini -- we agreed it was exactly how we like our martinis: extremely cold, with just the right balance, and awesome cheese stuffed olives. Our only disappointment was the mushroom pizza--the crust is nothing special and the toppings were just ok. We were so happy (and full) at that point, the so-so pizza didn't faze us at all. We'll just stick to ordering pizza at Humble in Lakewood, and come back to Lago for the pasta. A great evening all around!","date":"2014-09-25 12:49:26"}

Just because I feel generous. \n\nService: okay. When we walked in, a guy behind the counter just stared blankly at us and asked if it was dine-in and handed us menus and told us to sit where ever, so ok cool. It took about 10 minutes before the same guy came to us to approach us and ask for drink orders, and by this time, 2 other tables have sat. He was the only apparent server so I was trying to cut him slack (I work in the restaurant biz), but if you were the one who handed us menus and serve us...10 minutes is a stretch. He let my drink go empty twice, but partially my fault--I was thirsty. Didn't really come by and check if we needed anything, we eventually got what we needed ourselves by reaching onto the server's counter (sorry). There were about 5 tables in there around the time we went (6pm-6:30pm), so it wasn't that busy...service could've been better in my opinion. \n\nFood and Pricing: I ordered a medium bowl of pho dac biet, probably the most common pho in any pho restaurant. The portion was SMALLER than most pho restaurants I've been to, and more expensive than the other pho restaurants I've been to. It was about 10$ for a medium, and in my opinion, was NOT worth it. The broth is more on the bland side, so season well with the condiments. Probably about 6 pieces of meat in there max, so if you like a large portion of meat in your pho, don't eat here. I also ordered an order of spring rolls. They were eh, okay. They're small also compared to other restaurants, and of course, cost a little bit more than other restaurants. \n\nOverall: It was a whim coming in here, I probably won't be back because I live in Charlotte and was just in the area. If I was from the area, I'd probably try somewhere else also. The portion of the food just didn't match the price, you can find better pho elsewhere. Even if that means driving a little further. The service wasn't spectacular either to make up for the food. Pretty much to sum it up, mediocre. I'd recommend eating elsewhere!","date":"2016-12-19 08:04:45"}

The facility itself is very professional, simple and well decorated.  The rooms are very calming, clean and quiet.  The therapists themselves are very varied in their techniques and skill levels.  I have tried 5 different therapists before finally finding one who is AMAZING.  The first therapist I had was TERRIBLE and I felt like i wasted my money.  The good thing about this facility is that there are many therapists on staff so if you don't like one you then you can try another.  The other therapists were good for first timers or clients looking for a non-aggressive relaxing massage.  I enjoy high pressure deep tissue massages and I finally found an amazing therapist who I exclusively book appointments with.\n\nI had a couple of negative experiences where I got 2 eye stys immediately after my massage.  I noticed on both occasions that there was residue black eye makeup on the face towel where I lay my head.  I don't know if the face towel was reused but I also understand that mascara and eyeliner don't wash out of white towels so I just assumed that the towels were fresh at the time.  I also did not request to have them changed because I didn't want to be rude so that was my mistake and I can't prove that the towels were reused so I won't fault them for that.  \n\nIn summary, if you have signed up for a membership then take the time to really try different therapists and find the one that is right for you.

All the while the person is changing your oil, they pull other parts out of the car (air filter, etc) and ask that you get them replaced, even if they've been replaced somewhere else. When I told them I got the part fixed before, they asked \"where\" in an almost confronting manner, as if they never believed it was done. Some of the service was done by them only months prior, and they acted as if they couldn't find it within their computers. Shouldn't be that hard, if whenever I decline their service that they offer me besides the oil change, they remind me the next time that I declined them the last time. I argued with the last serviceman the last time I took my jeep in for a good 15 minutes about transmission flushes. \n\nStick to your guns while going here. If all you need is an oil+filter change, tell them that when you go there. Tell them that you are not interested in anything else, or that you do other maintenance measures yourself. Oil changes don't cost much, but when the salesy pitch is pulled out, you may end up spending an upwards of 300$ on something you don't really need!","date":"2015-08-19 05:20:48"}

Even though it's \"raw\" it's still really tasty and filling.

I've seen children at nearby tables take one bite, make a face and push the plate away, whereas in places where they cook the vegan food kids will have no idea that they're not eating chicken fingers or whatever the item is. \n\nThe service here is slow. And when I say slow I mean I aged considerably while waiting for my food. I wish I could say this only happened once, but it's happened every time I've been there.

I have to say, this is a very unique recipe of coconut sago and I love it. This coconut sago has taro chunks and egg.

My thoughts were Tang Soo Yook and Jjampong!!! \n\nWe walked in a few minutes before closing and asked the server if she was still serving... she went back to the kitchen to see if the light was still on. If the light is on, that means the Chef can still cook for us and luckily it was!!!\n\nI enjoyed their Tang Soo Yook, which is a deep fried pork that comes with a tangy jelly-like sauce.. similar to sweet and sour that they give you on the side to pour over. This came out steamy, hot!!! Tasted fresh and love the tempura\/cornstarch batter that makes this deep fried pork so delightful to eat. The oil that was used seem new and made this dish taste light and perfectly crisp. Each bite was pipin' hot and delicious. The sauce that completes this dish consists of sliced cucumber, carrot, napa cabbage, wood ear mushrooms, and onion. I would say, without this sauce.. it would be very plain jane and definitely wouldn't be as good. Love!\n\nMy minus one star was the Jjampong. Although it had chunks of seafood, it lacked flavor tremendously. It was like putting chunks of cayenne pepper in water and heating it up. The spices didn't really do it for me and I felt like there were some missing ingredients that could have done wonders for this soup. That was the only thing that wasn't so great, but I did enjoy the texture of the noodles in this soup very much. \n\nTheir side dishes is very limited to only daikon and kimchi. But their kimchi is very notable... my Father loves the kimchi here and so do I. Small bite size square cut shaped, lightly seasoned, crisp, with a solid homemade taste. If they sold this by the jar, I would definitely buy a few :) Delicious.\n\nThis restaurant is also very known for their Jjajangmyun. A thick black soybean paste sauce with diced meat (pork) and vegetables (mainly diced onion). Normally, if you ask for Jjajangmyun, the sauce is already pre-made, but you can ask the server to cook the sauce fresh, which is called Gan Jjajang myun. If you like your vegetables cooked well, then order Jjajangmyun. If you like your vegetables semi-raw, then you will enjoy Gan Jjajang myun. I enjoy mine cooked well and so does my Mother. My Father, on the other hand orders the semi-raw. I don't think anybody knows that they can order it this way, so just sharing how my Family and I order our food choices here.\n\nThe location is somewhat hidden.. it's tucked in a corner nearby 168 market.. in between the Furniture Store and Nelson Barber Shop. Even the name of this restaurant is written in Chinese Characters, so don't look for Shan Dong!! Good service, great meal, and satisfies my cravings for Korean-Chinese cuisine.","date":"2012-04-28 09:57:50"}

The names of the burger should speak for them selves but in case they don't let me sum it up for you....INSANE.  The Sumo Burger is 1 lbs of meat and the Super Sumo is 1.5 lbs of meat.  Not only are these burger massive but they taste amazing also.  Its massive and super messy and super hard to eat.  A good burger is a messy burger.  Well that's what I say at least.  I have visited C & Dubbs many times but my last visit i realized I had never reviewed it.  On my last visit of course I had the Sumo Burger but I shared the fries as the burger and a whole plate of fries would have been way to much for me.  Burger was super juicy and tasty.

So I decided to go up to the front to ask about how long it might take and the hostess basically ignored me and turned around and started yelling to her coworkers about how annoyed she was that \"people\" kept coming up and asking her about the wait. Long story short, we finally make it into the buffet area and were seated.  We had to wait about 10 minutes before we were even brought water. We finally got to the food only to find that it was not great. The fish was very dry. In all honesty the two things I really only enjoyed were the gumbo soup and cocktail shrimp. For the price of the buffet here and income of a casino I was expecting much higher quality food. We were also barely acknowledged by our waiter, and some of the other waiters were yelling slang to each other in the dining area. Very unprofessional. To top off our \"not so good experience\" we were told that we could not be refunded the $35.00 parking fee. But wait.. That's the only reason we parked there when we could have just payed $10 in the next parking garage. So $75 for a not so great dinner. We definitely won't be returning any time soon.

That being said, their \"best brunch in town\" claims may not be that far from the truth.\n\nI ordered the stuffed French toast, which featured two LARGE slices of sourdough bread, stuffed with mascarpone cheese, and topped with enough maple syrup, fresh strawberries, and whipped cream to put me into a sugar coma for the rest of the day.  Coming with a side of bacon, I couldn't ask for anything more.\n\nTheir brunch menu isn't extensive, but what they lack in options they make up for with pure quality, both in the ingredients they use and portion sizes they present.  My stuffed French toast left me entirely stuffed and very, very happy.\n\nIt's definitely on the pricier side ($13 for my meal, $15 for the plate my boyfriend ordered), but when I'm raving about the food to my coworkers on Monday morning, you know it's totally worth it.\n\nI'm not as smitten with the service (we were starving and it was a little on the slow side), but everyone was friendly enough, and I will most definitely be back in the very near future.","date":"2012-09-10 14:25:55"}

This would not be the reason to come here, although I do get it from time to time. It's not the best, it's not the worst I've ever had. The broth is so-so, unremarkable. Also, I don't get cilantro with my veggie plate, which I think is really weird. \n\nDrinks: They have a great selection of fun cocktails. \n\nStarters: Get the firecracker shrimp with the garlic noodles.

To keep this short we were lied to about personal training contracts which set off a cascade of events.  We had personal training for a year with LA.  When that expired we went to cancel our training and were told, at the time of signing, that we could use any banked sessions after canceling.  The personal training manager at the gym on Riverview (Peter) told us this was not the case and to prevent our 16 banked sessions from expiring 30 days later we could change our contract to one session per month.  We did.  After that we could never get in with our trainer.  We would show up to discover that he was working with someone else, we would schedule times with him and then they would mysteriously fall off the schedule, and we even noticed that we were being charged for sessions with other trainers that we didn't book.  We believe that Peter was filling our trainer's schedule with new clients and pushing us off since we were on our way out. When talking to Peter he was sure to inform us of his salary and that to keep his position he needs to keep his body fat under a certain percentage.\n\nI spoke with James T. (VP of Personal Training) and we worked out a deal.  We were refunded some of the sessions we had banked and could keep the balance without them expiring.  We had to take a few months off of lifting due to an injury so this was a great arrangement.\n\nWhen we went to use the sessions we were told they had expired.  I contacted James to get them back.  After four weeks and five voice messages James never called me back.  I emailed the customer service email and they eventually called me.  They only gave me 3 sessions back.  I told them this was unacceptable as we should have had 4 and that I would not allow them to just steal the session.  I then received a call from the Regional Operations Manager for Phoenix.  He agreed to refund us for the one session that was still in dispute.\n\nWe went to the gym on Stapley\/University to use our three sessions.  We were very specific about what we wanted.  All we needed at this time was help to perfect squat and deadlift form.  We were told that Joseph is the guy for that.  We scheduled a time to work with Joseph.  We showed up as scheduled and the front desk informed us that he doesn't work at that time.  We checked the schedule in the app to find out that somebody moved our appointment with Joseph from a saturday to a thursday without contacting us.  We then rescheduled a time with Joseph.\n\nWhen we met Joseph for our session he very arrogently and aggressively scolded me for asking him to only help us with form. \"That's not how training works, if you're going to work out with me I'm going to make your plan and you're going to do what I say.\"  We spoke with the manager and he told me we could either work out with Joseph or not, but that we would be charged for the session.  We were very specific when we scheduled the session that we did not want him to make a plan and that all we needed was help with our form.  \n\nI chose not to challenge this because I was tired of having to speak with people in upper management to resolve issues caused in the gym and this was the third strike for LA Fitness.  We were charged the session and we will simply allow the last two sessions to go unused rather than giving LA another opportunity to disappoint us.  We have canceled our membership and will work out at a different gym moving forward.\n\nThroughout our time at LA Fitness we have been treated as a bank for which to remove money.

The servers are really nice and really cute :o. Lol. Anyway, we wanted to get a hachapuri and some khinkali (georgian dumplings). There were no pictures on the menu, but even the photos on yelp were hard to distinguish the sizing and portion of food. Let me say upon arrival of our food I was shocked by how generous the portions were! The Khinkali dumplings each of them were like the size of a small person's fist. And the hachapuri was the size of a small pizza. Very filling indeed, even when sharing with a friend. We both loved the food. The khinkali pork and beef had some interesting spices...tasted very beefy and rich. I needed to cleanse the palate with some of their tangy dipping sauces from time to time. Their sauces are really tasty btw. They come as a complimentary appetizer with some hot buns on the side.\n\nThe food was so memorable! I would love to come back to try some other Georgian dishes.

If it hadn't been for Macon and her partner in crime, Alex Woodford, it may not have happened.  Those two were so awesome, patient and understanding about how I needed time to review the information and consider everything before making the final decision.  Between my hesitation and thorough research, I ended up delaying the process for about over a week or more, but because of their patience and just awesomeness all around, we walked out with a better car than I had even expected in the end.\n\n   Again, Macon Wild is the person to see at Enterprise Car Sales in Las Vegas.

I am definitely glad that I decided to go with the Best Bang for Your Buck Groupon experience for two at Gun Garage. Not only do you get to shoot more guns at this venue it seems, but it also seems more suited to novices as well. They provide you with transportation to and from the strip. The driver was nice and very conversational. \n\nOnce we got to the gun garage all we had to do was fill out a form, show our IDs, and listen to our gun range officer and we were ready to go. Our range safety officer's name was James and he was extremely friendly and polite. He knew both of us had never shot a gun before and so he made sure he went over all of the proper steps with us more than once. Not once throughout our entire time there did we feel intimidated. He even gave us support while we were firing because we had never felt recoil before. \n\nIn all we got to shoot A LOT of guns (9 I believe), much more than with the similarly priced deals at Battlefield Vegas. Although the whole experience only lasts about 15-20 minutes per person it felt like a really long time probably because it was our first time shooting and because of all of the adrenaline pumping. I definitely want to go back and shoot my favorite guns with more clips since I now know which ones I like. All in all though this is definitely the perfect venue for people who have never held a gun in their hands before.","date":"2017-06-17 19:08:43"}

Pump up your AC! Especially since your kitchen shares the bar & dining room and the majority of your dishes are HOT, never mind your clientele. ;-)\n\n2 of the 3 stars go to:\n\n1) Jarod: the epitome of a composed and well-conducted host. If you look up \"host\" in the dictionary, Jarod's picture should be displayed. He was bombarded every minute from our arrival to when we were eventually seated. He was calm, collected and extremely pleasant. The best part, when he came to fetch us at Central Wine he said, \"Your table is ready. Don't rush. You waited for us. We will wait for you.\" *Phenomenal* \n\n2) Courteous Wait Staff: at no point did we receive any attitude to our hungry and impatient (did I mention over-heated?) dispositions. Instead, we were comped and sweetened with desert and smiles.\n\nThe 2 hour wait to be served a semblance of food & beverage from check-in to seating is absurd. We arrived at 7:20 and were told a couple tables had bills and should be cleared \"shortly\". A stuffy 30 min later we informed our patient host that we would be at Central Wine (a fantastically COOL waiting area). Once we were seated (around 8:20) we were greeted, a beverage and app order taken - both were served together about 12 min later. Thank goodness we had water refilled. Seriously, it had to be 81 degrees in the dining room. We ordered our entrees right away.\n\nI have to say the \"special\" was quite tasty: salmon sashimi, seaweed, carrots, mandarin oranges and I believe some small grapefruit over brown rice. There was no way I was going to handle a steaming plate\/bowl of anything in that heat. My husband was disappointed at the amount of duck in his Massaman Curry. The noodles far outweighed the 5, possibly 6, thinly sliced pieces of duck. And he was generous to share a piece with me, but once I saw how little he had I felt bad and offered it back. I tasted a bit and it tantalized the tastebuds but left much to desire ... more duck!\n\nPerhaps Friday night is not the time to dine at Clever Koi. I would like to give it another chance, as this kind of pleasant service is hard to find anymore. I think I'll wait until October or November to tantalize my longing for their Spicy Seafood Hot Pot. Right now, I cringe at the thought of nose-planting from the heat into the spicy lava of tentacles.","date":"2014-07-28 01:27:02"}

If you sit on the right side, Tomo shares an adjacent wall with a noisy night club, and your table will thump with hip-hop music. This obviously isn't their fault for having noisy neighbors, but it can definitely hinder a first date or good conversation.\n\nThis also goes for choosing when to eat there. I recommend Friday night, before the bar crowds start rolling into the neighborhood. You'll find better parking, and it will be a quieter experience. As for the food, the sushi at Tomo is quality for the prices, but be prepared to spend a little more than usual. The presentation is beautiful, and the service is fast considering their busy Warehouse District location. I absolutely love the Indian Roll and the Sexy Girl roll, and I must mention how nice it is to have a hibachi downtown. The sushi is worthy of a visit, but if you don't have time to sit down, they will never fail you on takeout.","date":"2016-03-06 23:43:57"}

Walk in and an employee will hand you a handy, dandy card which you use to swipe and accumulate expenses at various food stations (pasta, salad, antipasto, pizza, bar, dessert). It's convenient and not too crowded. Apparently the pasta is made fresh daily and they actually cook the dish in front of you--note, this significantly increases your wait time. \n\nI ordered the Pasta Vongole (one of the specials listed in front of the pasta station - $9.95). It was supposed to have white wine, clams, garlic, capers, and anchovies. However, upon closer inspection, my capers and anchovies must have vanished in thin air. The pasta is good, but the dish as a whole lacked flavor. LIke past reviewers, I also found my pasta dry (however, one of my friends had pasta that looked like it was sauced in soup). Serving sizes are huge though (considering how filling pasta can be). My friend who got the carbonara said the sauce was much too heavy but he really enjoyed his side caesar salad. \"The anchovy flavor was great.\" I also got the trio of bruschetta ($4.50) and white chocolate mousse ($2.75) to go. \n\nFinally, I had some issues with the card they provided in that it charged me almost $10 more than it should have when I went to check out. Fortunately, the cashiers were understanding and removed the mysteriously appearing dishes from my check. Overall, I would give this place a second chance since the fresh-made pasta actually has a great texture and the employees are friendly. It's also a great alternative to fast food and traditional sit-down restaurants.","date":"2012-06-26 02:43:12"}

Unfortunately, the food and service were awful.  We will not be back.  \n\nWhen we arrived at around 9:30 on a Saturday morning, the restaurant was not crowded.  Even so, the service was very slow.  There seemed to be one waiter and one busboy on duty.  The waiter seated us and then vanished.  My husband finally went over to the coffee station, brought the pot  to our table and filled our empty cups.  The coffee was fair -- not great.  We eventually saw the waiter, at the back of the room talking on his cell phone.  After a wait of nearly half an hour, we were getting up to leave.  The busboy suddenly appeared and took our order.\n\nOur meal arrived quickly.  The busboy who brought our food dropped the containers of jam onto the floor, picked them up, stacked them back in their little holder and put them onto our table.  Needless to say, we skipped the jam.  We asked repeatedly for butter for our toast & biscuit, and finally my husband headed for the kitchen to find some.  He was intercepted by the busboy, who brought butter.  By this time, our toast & biscuit were stone cold.\n\nMy veggie omelet was so greasy that I couldn't eat it.  My biscuit was obviously a pre-packaged item, which had been split and toasted on the grill in an apparent effort to make it seem fresh.\n\nMy husband's scrambled eggs and sausage were OK -- nothing special.  The bacon strips were curled up in little balls ... apparently no one in the kitchen knows how to cook bacon.  The sliced tomato was good.\n\nThe menu is enormous.  Based on our experience this morning, I would guess that most of the food is precooked, prepackaged and just heated in the microwave or otherwise warmed for service.  Icky!\n\nIf you want a delicious, fresh breakfast in Fountain Hills, our best recommendations are Sofrita on Avenue of the Fountains (great coffee, interesting fresh food, creative decor) or EuroPizza Cafe on Saguaro in Lakeside Plaza (good coffee, good fresh food, lovely view of the lake and fountain).  For bagels, try DJs on Palisades in the Safeway center.  We would suggest steering clear of Kimmie's.","date":"2013-07-13 19:19:14"}

We felt as if we were being rushed and there no great customer service at all what so ever. The male servers were kind at least. \n\nRamen was okay. We both ordered the miso ramen. They say it's thick noodles but it seems thin? It isn't as good as jinya, monta or Fukiramen. But this place is new so hopefully it gets better! They just need to work on those few things.

This example of administrative ineptness will prevent me from seeking out Western Dental for actual business.\n\nUpdate:  Thank you to Cynthia for the reply below.  However, I do not wish to share personal information with a company I do not and have never done business with, and the phone calls I am receiving from Western Dental ask for a different person than me.  Having spent nearly 5 years with metal train-track braces until the age of 17, I have an aversion for dentists and have not seen one in 20+ years.  I also have only owned this phone number for 4 years.  Therefore, I am confident you will not find my name or birth date within your records.   Yes, I still have all my teeth and the money my parents spent every month over those long 5 years has not gone to waste.  With my repeated requests (including twice in the last two days) to remove my phone number from Western Dental records and now that I have blocked 602-258-2371 from my phone, I do not expect to receive calls from Western Dental.  If Western Dental chooses to call from a different phone number, rather than following through with removing my phone number as promised, then I will be glad to update this post again with those calls.","date":"2017-09-20 18:39:03"}

So I did some research and discovered that there was a shop in Vegas, and wouldn't you know.. I had a trip planned already for Spring Break! \n\nVisiting the shop was the only thing on my itinerary for that weekend, and when I finally was able to drag my bro and sis there, we were in heaven. I walked off with a bagful of bars and some toffee, plus a few gifts for friends. At least 2 flavors are available for samples on the counter, but more importantly you can sample almost everything with the assistance of the staff. After my lengthy visit, I had sampled more than half of the options I think! What a great chocolate coma I had the rest of the day.  \n\nBesides the great product, what I was really impressed with was the friendly staff. I got a lot of great information and tips from the woman who helped me, and she was more than happy to give me and my family plenty of samples and suggestions. Those of you that read my reviews know how much I appreciate great service like this.

Our first reservation choice wasn't Sunday but it was the only time we could get in. This was my first visit to Chima and my boyfriend's second visit. We arrived right at 7:30 and waited about 10 minutes before our table was ready. The restaurant was pretty easy to find and valet parking was complimentary.  We ate upstairs which I understand is less crowded than the downstairs dining area.\n\nThe restaurant was right downtown Charlotte and the decor was modern, sleek and warm. First portion of the three-course meal was the salad bar, which in my opinion is enough for a meal. I don't know if they offer that alone but it might be a good idea if they ever decide to open for lunch. It also might be appealing to those of us who can't justify spending fifty bucks there outside of restaurant week since the meal is just way too much for the average person to eat in my opinion.\n\nThe salad bar was very decadent and consisted of beef carpaccio, caprese salad, shrimp salad, a nice variety of greens, melon, soy beans, chicken salad, waldorf salad and few others items. There was also a wide variety of dressings, sauces for your meats, a couple different types of rice, three or four different soups, and bread with butter. \n\nAfter visiting the salad bar you sit down and the men come by with a variety of meats. My favorite was by far the top sirloin; second favorite was the parmesan pork tenderloin. It was pretty salty but still good. I also had the filet mignon wrapped with bacon but it was pretty fatty for a filet. I also enjoyed the flank steak and chicken. My boyfriend really enjoyed the ribs. I also had the swordfish, which I found to be a bit dry, and the lamb, which was too gamy for my liking. While we were being served the meats we had other side items being served to us. I forgot to mention the appetizer, which were doughy Parmesan rolls with a turkey dip, very good. The side items were fried bananas and some fried potato sticks, which tasted like hash browns. I personally didn't care for the fried bananas but I don't like bananas much anyway.\n\nBelieve it or not we ordered dessert. It didn't come with the meal but I wanted a little something sweet. So we ordered the crème brulee. It stole the show. We finished that off in about five minutes. Maybe the best crème brulee I have ever had. \n\nService was very good and I was pleased. I enjoyed the experience but I wouldn't go back for myself. It's just way too much food and I would rather savor one entree instead of be constantly paraded with more food while I am trying to eat what I have. I would love to go back just for the salad bar and dessert though. They had a lot of other choices for dessert as well. They don't give boxes for your leftovers either so eat up!","date":"2012-02-01 04:09:56"}

I can't say the actual name, but I'll use my best Engrish - Beef & Shrimp marinated salad\/beef skewers\/pot roast soup\/fried tilapia topped with mango.  Okay sounds to me like a typical cuisine, but no dude....it was awesome.  Found out Cambodian cuisine is not spicy like I thought it would be.  \n\nOur service was great, this when the restaurant was booked by our entire group - Kudos!

I didn't want to touch anything; felt like I was in a museum.\n\nTowards the end of the night I start to make dessert - yes \"Me\" was cooking!  They showed us how and what ingredients.

There were some rude international folks that feel like they have to fight you for bargains, i.e. grab items that were in front of you... so be prepared for that! Its pretty busy in there every time I go, and the line is also long, but worth it to save some money. They usually have a good amount of cashiers working. Some of the staff is really nice, others are not. Some are just terrible. There was this one lady putting a basket of sunglasses on the rack. A customer next to me, reached across me to grab into the basket. The employee told her she couldn't do that and that she would have to wait for her to set them on the rack. Which I understand, because the glasses would be all over the floor if the customer went diving into them. The funny part ....as the employee was filling the rack, she took her time and spun the freshly placed sunglasses towards the wall, away from that lady. The customer looked SO mad.

For a Tuesday night, it was pretty busy but certainly not full. The food was not bad, not the best I've ever had but definitely above average and the service was pretty good!\n\nI had a glass of the Pinot Grigio which I enjoyed. I notice the list of white wines was a bit smaller. There were a lot more red wine choices and most of the choices were for entire bottles. The prices were a bit on the higher side but it's a beautiful restaurant in Yorkville so that's to be expected.\n\nI had the spinach salad which was good but I found there were too many sweet elements. The salad dressing was a strawberry vinaigrette and there were figs and dried cranberries and some sort of crispy onions and bocconcini cheese. I would have enjoyed a goats cheese or something to cut the sweetness of it. The elements were fresh tasting however. We also ordered the burrata appetizer that came with a sizable ball of burrata cheese and prosciutto on a bed of arugula. The burrata was delicious and the portion was good for the price. \n\nI had the gnocchi as my main, which while was filling, was a small portion on a huge plate. I saw some other dishes like the lasagna and pizzas and panzerotti and they were a lot larger. Maybe I'd go with one of those options next time. The pasta was also somewhat mediocre in my opinion, the sauce wasn't the best and the ricotta on top didn't really add much to it. \n\nSince we were there for a birthday, we also got a Nutella pizza to share. I love Nutella so that was good but I found the crust to be really chewy in some parts and burnt in other parts. There were also a total of 5 banana slices on the pizza and a few hazelnuts sprinkles on top. It was a nice after dinner treat but it wasn't amazing. \n\nThe service was pretty good. The food came a bit slow but it's not a fast food restaurant so you can't expect that. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. Modern and warm and stylish. The kitchen is open so you can see the pizzas being made which is really cool. \n\nOverall this is a nice spot for dinner. The prices are on the higher side but not outrageously so, especially for the area. It's definitely a cool, stylish place with pretty good food.

My co-workers who were drinking though the drinks were weak especially at the $9 mark.  Likewise it took three people to find me a glass of water without ice and lemon.\n\nThe food was just okay - but when you pay these prices and are in a trendy location I really expected more.  Two dishes out of 10 people were sent back and finally one was removed from the bill.  The sea salt chips were great as an appetizer but I thought my salmon was really overcooked.  Again, it wasn't bad, but I expected more.\n\nI probably wouldn't go back, as when I travel I like to find really good places to eat and when the place doesn't give me a good vibe I just move on to discover something else.  I wish them the best, but it seemed like the customers were there more because it was the \"trendy place to go\" and not because the food was outstanding. \n\n Again, I think the hostesses did the most, the original server was great - but in a party of 10 we shouldn't have to raise our hands to see who ordered what each time the drinks arrived.

In comparison, the fresh-out-of-the-oven offerings at St-Viateur were transcendant, with slightly crunchy shells giving way to sweet steaming carb flesh.\n\nThat said, the bagel with lox and cream was excellent.  Compared to NY, sandwiches feature maybe a third of the cream cheese volume, allowing for a more careful taste of the fish and bagel.  No onions or capers.\n\nCash only; Fairmount takes USD, but at an awful 1:1 conversion (versus St-Viateur's rough 5:6?).  Bring your loons.","date":"2016-02-24 00:15:38"}

We opted out of taking the ambulance because you know...thats expensive. Well my roommate and I regret that. We waited 3 hours in the lobby. My roommate had shortness of breath and sever abdominal pain, on the paperwork it says if either one of those is in your symptoms then notify hospital staff for immediate assistance. So of course I let them know but we still waited for 3 hours, if it was super serious, I am sure my roommate would be passed out in the lobby by then. The lady with glasses and long hair, a little on the bigger side, was very rude and showed no care what so ever when I told her that my roommate could not breath. So finally after 3 hours we get called in, they do some basic tests then send us back out to the lobby again. Another hour later we finally got admitted in. The nurse Shaundra is amazing! She was very friendly and helpful along with an EMT guy named Ben Davis. Both of them were amazing but unfortunately we lost them after 40 minutes because of a shift change and we ended up getting really grumpy staff. The doctor during the whole situation was a little off, she kept laughing for no reason when she would explain what was wrong with my roommate. I don't know if that is a medical issue she is going through herself but I felt it was a little unprofessional to laugh while explaining what is wrong with a patient. Anyways my roommate had 1 ultrasound and 2 cts. Seven hours later, waiting in the hospital, they finally gave us some results and said that they don't know what is causing the pain and shortness of breathe but you also have gastritis and a few cysts on your ovaries but thats not what causing your symptoms but here is your medicine for the other stuff. Have a good night. So my roommate was sent home still in severe pain because the hospital could not figure out what was going on. Very helpful.

The sandwich was just as you'd imagine, but the egg and mornay sauce add so much to it.  The mornay sauce was rich and velvety smooth.  The egg enhanced the sandwich the same way adding a fried egg to a cheese burger does.\nIt also came with pommes frites, or in english, \"french fries\", and a whole mound of them!  So much that a table of 4 could not finish them.   They were really good, maybe in the top 5 fries ever.  After all who makes French fries better than the French?  Well maybe McDonnalds... Wait, did i just compare Bouchon to McDonnalds?  Anyway they were light, crispy, and delicious.\n\nWe also ordered french beignets.  I was expecting something like the beignets in New Orleans where they are light and covered with powdered sugar.  These were a bit heavier and both resembled and tasted like cake doughnuts.  Although they were warm and probably the best cake doughnut I've ever had, it was not what i was expecting and was a bit of a let down.  I would have been fine with it, but when it was brought to the table they said, \"your doughnuts.\"  Let's get one thing straight here, I'd gladly pay $8 for 3 french beignets, but NOT for 3 doughnuts!  \n\nPros:  Great bakery items especially the Croissant, Tons of delicious french fries, delicious meals with great sauces. \n\nCons: Beignets are okay but not the type you find in New Orleans, definitely not worth $8 for 3 the size of \"Hostess Donettes\".   \n\nAdvice:  There is a embosser next to the entrance with some pieces of thick card stock.  you can emboss the bouchon name in it for a keep sake.  not sure if you're supposed to do it or what it's for but i did, and now use it as my bookmark.","date":"2009-10-14 02:53:46"}

While it's not the most adventurous meal of my life, it did delight me with all my favorites -- a black truffle trio, osetra caviar, foie gras, duck, Santa Barbara uni, etc... and an incredibly beautiful 3 course dessert.  It is culinary perfection in the most romantic setting. What more could you ask for? More Caviar? Well, you probably won't because their caviar portions are the most generous I've seen! Bonus points for them there. \n\nI could describe the food, but if you're a foodie like me, you already know the drill -- The food is good so I will not describe every dish. You get everything that is absolutely delicious, cooked to perfection, and plated beautifully.  And the ambiance, while some may say is gaudy, is very thoughtful and there is much to appreciate about it. The walled garden in one room, a beautiful welcoming bar in another, etc.... there is much to appreciate about this place and Joel Robuchon's attention to detail.\n\nHowever, a few things that needed improvement or felt a little strange: \n1) One of the things I found tacky was the $15 water charge.  If you're charging over $800\/person for the meal plus pairing, water charges should just be waived or just tacked onto the food charge. I see this as a terrible faux pas, especially for a three michelin star restaurant.\n2) Someone was getting on-the-job training at our table. This would be OK but out of the three times I got up to use the restroom, I only found my napkin folded twice.\n3) Joel Robuchon has a fantastic limo service where they pick you up in a limo to the restaurant... but it was not available during \"the holidays\" much to our large party's dismay. It would've been nice to know this when we booked our table.\n4) The soft-boiled egg seemed more like a hard-boiled egg to me. It was cooked on a higher-temperature side of things.\n5) The wait staff is not in sync (all plates put down at the same time, etc...) like they usually are at this level of dining.\n\nThe menu was about $600\/person, and my boyfriend and I split the most basic wine pairing for $250. At that price point, it better be perfect. And it was. But perfection comes with a downside -- it's that I think Joel Robuchon played it very safe. If you're a hardcore foodie, I think you may find the menu slightly on the 'safe' side (and in that case try é by José Andrés).  But if you're here for the Vegas experience and want to try a solid 3-star menu with a fantastic ambiance, this is the place to go. Highly recommend. Definitely more of a 4.5 stars from me.","date":"2015-01-03 22:52:55"}

A friend and I met for a meal on a recent Friday at 11:00am and were seated right away. The menu offers up breakfast and lunch items, many of them comfort food style: chicken n waffles, grilled cheese sandwiches, as well as a Fat Elvis sandwich (French toast, Nutella, bacon, peanut butter, and strawberries).  The 'made to order' part applies to the breakfast, where you can choose a wrap, omelet, or skillet form for options that include avocado, salmon, chicken, chili, and broccoli.\nI had the MTO breakfast:  3 eggs, chicken sausage, 2 slices of turkey bacon, 2 slices of regular bacon, 2 slices of Spam, mash browns, and toast.  Opting for egg whites and sourdough toast, it was a larger than normal meal for me with all of that meat.  The bacon was made just right, but the Spam wasn't cooked long enough and the turkey bacon was buried underneath the eggs and just limp. The chicken sausage was good, too.  The mash browns are a combo of mashed potatoes and hash browns and I enjoyed those very much.  I left one slice of Spam and half a slice of chicken sausage on my plate, full from all that food.  \nI used my Yelp check-in offer of free Walnut Tossies when we got there.  Our server had never seen it before so she took my phone over to another waitress who cleared it with her boss.  Said boss, Ben, came over to our table and introduced himself as one of the owners.  Apparently I was the first person to use the check-in so he asked how it worked on the phone app, I showed him, and he was very happy.  I was happy with the Walnut Tossies at the end of the meal for dessert, 3 little mini-pastries of walnut and brown sugar.  \nOverall, it was a good experience, especially since my friend treated me to this meal.  I don't spend $14 on breakfast on a normal basis, but I'll come back to try some of the lunch items.

Very fresh and the rice was light and fluffy. The kind of sushi I like to close my eyes and enjoy while eating it. When I went to pick it up, I was surprised at how nice the restaurant was inside.

Pass on the blue corn bbq duck pancake, taste was fairly salty\/heavy and one-dimensional. \n\nMAINS\nChile crusted rabbit was excellent - serving portion is manageable, plated with toasted couscous (excellent pairing) and fava beans. Rabbit was perfectly roasted and flavorful, slightly gamey. There are only 3 steaks on feature - black Angus NY strip, coffee-rubbed filet mignon and bone-in chipotle-glazed ribeye. Coworker enjoyed the coffee-rubbed filet.\n\nSIDES\nCauliflower gratin with roasted poblano was delicious and creamy. Double-baked potato with horseradish, scallion had a subtle horseradish note, which was a good complement to the meal. \n\nService was attentive and helpful with recommendations. Ambiance is fairly average.","date":"2012-05-29 07:19:42"}

Having got off the plane in Charlotte and looking for a place to eat in town, we came across a place that looked nice and different and was actually open Sunday night.\n\nHarry's is a combination bar\/restaurant in the town of Ayrsley. Surrounding the area are trees, small office buildings and the highway, along with some local businesses and such. When you go in, there is someone to greet you. Directly in front of you is the bar along with some small seating on the left. On the right are some booths and tables for larger parties.\n\nThey have a small menu for food, but a larger menu for drinks and cocktails. I ended up ordering their burger of the day, which came with fries and one other side that I can't remember right now. The burger was big and satisfying and so were the fries, albeit a bit salty.\n\nWhat surprised me was the cleanliness and the amount of service they gave us. The server checked in on us multiple times and so did the manager. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it, but in light of this review, I would consider it a positive aspect to mention.\n\nI wish I were able to review other food spots in the area, but even considering this was our only place that we went to eat out, it was a good choice. The place is good for watching the game, or hanging out with people.","date":"2012-05-29 17:49:23"}

I've witnessed the person behind the counter rub their coworker's neck (greasy curls falling all over their gloves) and then turn to make my burrito; touching my food with the same gloves.  At other times, I've watched them drag the burrito across the counter top, pulling whatever germs were there along with \"my food.\"  On yet another occasion, I witnessed them pulling up a container from behind a burrito belonging to a customer in front of me.  The container dropped a bunch of dirty water onto it.  Needless to say, I watch really carefully now when they make my food.  Also, this location has a few girls working here that are damn annoying; always yelling and laughing to the point of irritation.\n\nTHE SUM-IT-UP:\nGood food but HIGHLY unsanitary at times.  Roll the dice...\n\nUPDATE MONTH'S LATER:  I decided to lower my guard and go here today.  What a mistake.  I ordered the 4 crunchy tacos.  And, where every other decent Chipotle will fill each taco separately - as they indeed should - this one took it to the opposite extreme.  The girl behind the counter was lazy and indifferent. She plopped each of the salsa's on top of the shells, not in them.  By the time she was about to put the lettuce on that I had asked for, I had to stop her.  I said, \"Stop.  Please.  You've completely covered the shells.  I can't even see them any longer.  You've done nothing but make a giant mess that I have to fix up if I'm going to eat a taco that has something in it.\"\n\nShe got all huffy like, \"Well, I never!\"  Too bad.  If nobody tells her that her absolute laziness is making a mess of my meal, she will never change.  (And by the way - it was not busy at the time. In fact, it was nearly dead in there.  She had no good excuse.)\n\nI'll never eat at this sh#thole Chipotle again.  The others aren't so bad, but this location truly - truly - just doesn't give a damn.","date":"2006-05-27 21:51:01"}

I came in with acrylic that he removed with the tool, not even soak them or file them down.  Well, he got really upset.  Got up, grabbed his stuff, and said some things in Vietnamese about me didn't tell him the right service.   I speak Vietnamese fluently btw.  I felt that by this tech, I wasn't treated with respect.  He totally just bounced, who does that.   Anyways, the front desk guy did apologized for the misunderstanding and now I have to wait for a different guy to finish my nails.

The consensus is that he's an ex-bouncer and doesn't even know how to manage to make a drink much less manage a high-profile restaurant.\n\nThere seems to be too many staff running around pretending to be busy than actually working.  I saw no less than 3 managers pretty much walking the floor doing nothing.  None of them went up to any tables to inquire about the food, the service or anything that would normally be relevant to their jobs. There were too many hostesses worried about their outfits and make-up and being seen. \n\nNow, onto the food. Again, WOW. It was beyond awful--once it actually came out.  Apparently our ticket got dropped TWICE by the kitchen. And, did any manager come out to apologize and try to make nice? Uh, that'd be a no.\n\nThat's where the wonderful and awfully helpful \/insert sarcasm here Chad came over. And he only came over because we actually asked the waiter where the manager was and why he wasn't the one trying to sooth things over with us.  Instead, we told him what we expected from our service. Comped food, a steep discount and free dessert\/coffee\/tea. At least he had the competency to do that, so I guess there is some hope. BUT, the best part is--he wasn't the one telling us. Our poor waiter was the one breaking the news. Isn't that a manager's job?\n\nThe waiter and his trainee were so sweet and trying to help out, but honestly, what else can they do? I think they pretty much gave up when they knew how much of the dinner was going to be cut, therefore reflecting their tip. We made sure they were compensated for their work. As for the main tab? Aw hale naw.  Took whatever discount they gave us. Normally our group would order 1-2 desserts to share. Yeah, call us greedy and bitter, but we each ordered one.  The sad thing is? Even the dessert took 15 minutes to come out AND it wasn't good.\n\nThe one star was because our waiter actually tried so hard.\n\nFinal report: More style than substance.","date":"2010-01-09 10:34:58"}

There was only one other table occupied and the waiter returned within 1 minute to ask if we knew what we wanted as the kitchen was closing in 5 mins, giving the impression that he would be just as happy if we left. Posted closing time is an early 10 pm. Unfortunately, we stayed...\n\nI sat my reading glasses case down on the table when we arrived. When I went to pick it up to read the menu, it was practically stuck to the table. Classy, eh? After some mediocre tortilla chips and salsa, we both had the combination platter described in the previous review and guava margaritas. All of it was utterly bland, so I asked for some Tabasco. The server informed me there was no Tabasco and was walking away when I called after him asking if they had any other hot sauce instead. He grudgingly brought another very spicy sauce and spent the remainder of the evening cleaning tables, stacking chairs and generally making it clear that he wanted us out of there ASAP. I did manage to request a glass of water from him as he reached across the table mid-meal to remove our candle. The lights were very bright, so I asked another server if they could be turned down. After asking if I wanted to go to sleep (!), she turned them down just a touch, but a few minutes later our waiter turned them on full blast. By this point the place had less ambiance than your average McDonalds at 3 am. No one ever inquired if we were happy with our food (we were not). The hot sauce I'd begged for added the only taste. The 'quesadilla' was practically an empty tortilla. I know where to find much better tacos and enchiladas in Toronto for less money. The margarita was ok, but it wasn't enough to make this joint acceptable.","date":"2013-05-29 03:35:27"}

This was our second visit since their remodel. We were a little apprehensive given some of the bad reviews I read prior to this visit so we actually booked a comped room at the Orleans as back up. We chose to pay for the Plaza because we prefer to stay downtown. I am happy to say we didn't need to use our back up room and stayed all three nights at the Plaza.\n\nCheck was a breeze even though we were there at 1pm, they had 5 people working so the line moved very quickly and since I had picked up a $2 Coors before getting in line I was fine with the wait. Robert at check in was very pleasant and since I explained my apprehension to him he worked very hard to make sure we had a good room. He really wanted to make sure we had a good floor but couldn't get us a King bed on the floor he wanted for us so I took the two queens which isn't a real big deal. I couldn't be happier with his service.\n\nWe were given a very nice room in the south tower on the 21st floor with a nice view of the strip. The room was as we remembered from our last visit. The furnishings are nice and in good shape. the bed's were comfortable but the pillows were a little lacking. The room was clean and believe me we checked thoroughly before unpacking. The room is good size for Downtown. The only things I would have liked the room to have would be a coffee maker (we brought our own instead) and a refrigerator (which is rare downtown except at the Main street Station). The floor we were on was quite and didn't smell of smoke. In fact I think in the three nights there I only saw one other person on the floor. Maid service was always prompt and thorough. She even left a couple extra waters for us each day (probably due to a nice tip every morning).\n\nThe Casino at the Plaza is ok. We played some slot machines and the electronic crap machine a lot. Drink service was good. We mainly play Blackjack though and I don't care to much for the tables there. We prefer the double deck 3\/2 at the Cal. We did play one evening with some of the Girls around the dancing stage. Even though they pay 6\/5 and use auto shufflers, which I hate, the girls were actually very funny and we had a good time. We did play at the craps table a few times and the dealers were all very nice and friendly.\n\nWe saw a couple of comedians at the comedy club one night. The tickets were a little overpriced for the show, even with the 2 for 1 coupon, but we had fun and didn't feel to bad about doing it. The drinks at Z bar while we waited for the show to start were great.\n\nIsland Sushi is a nice little place, prices are great and the food was very good. the fish tasted fresh and clean. The sizes were a little small but given the price I cant complain to much we just ordered more. \n\nPop up Pizza is amazing especially at 1 or 2 am after drinking vodka and playing cards all night. \n\nThe Mexican place in the food court has a great breakfast burrito.\n\nAll in all a nice trip especially since I am a rate watcher and got all three nights over the weekend with resort fee for $128 total. \n\nThe Plaza is perfect for downtown stays. Right there for all the action but not so in the middle of it that it is crazy and loud like the D. It was nice to walk thru all of the noise and madness of Freemont on a Saturday night to come back to the Plaza and leave all of that on the other side of the street. We will be back for sure.","date":"2013-10-03 17:44:34"}

There were few vegetables, mostly carrots, and no attempt at any sort of condiment (peanuts, vinegar, fish sauce, etc.) other than a few bean sprouts. The Sriracha was really what saved the dish. The tofu was barely warm and pretty chewy.\n\nThe menu, and items therein, seem to be developed to appeal to broad and bland american palate. There are around 20 noodle dishes in three different categories, \"Asian\", \"Mediterranean\", and \"American\" as well as 5 sandwich dishes.\n\nOverall strikes me as a Panera Bread trying to piggy back on fresh concepts like Chipotle's success.

The salon is really nice and clean. The spa is on the top floor and it is very quiet and relaxing. The staff is super friendly, they offered me tea (and I dont even like tea but this one was really good). The girl who took care of me was Eva. She is super nice and friendly, and she did a fantastic job. She makes you feel very relaxed and comfortable and her massages are amazing. The facial was 70$+tip. My face is usually extremely red after a facial because I have very sensitive skin, but yesterday was not bad at all. The extractions doesn't hurt compared to other places. The only cons would be that the don't extract milia around the eyes, and I would have liked a deeper extraction. Very good experience overall. I will definitely be back!\n\n*UPDATED:\nAll the skin products I bought (cleanser, moisturizer, toner and essential oil) gave me really bad allergic reactions. Be careful if you have sensitive skin as a big number of Aveda products contain lavender. Lavender is NOT good for sensntive skin EVER. I had a terrible rash all over my face for 3 weeks. I could return the products but they gave me a gift card, not cash back. Now I have 150$ in an Aveda card that most likely I'll give to someone because I am not going to use any of their products ever again. So be careful if you have sensitive skin. Try little samples before buying any skincare product.","date":"2013-08-15 15:40:13"}

It looked like it was going to be cheap + delicious arancini and italian-style sandwiches. I was rather disappointed when I actually ate it.\n\nI love arancini. I love rice, and love rice with creaminess. And fried, crispy breading? Arancini is a delicious union of the two. Unfortunately Corrado's arancini doesn't quite measure up. Sure, they're pretty big, and the filling is actually creamy and tasty, but I don't see the point of smothering the arancini with tomato sauce as you can't taste any of the crunch or crispiness of the breading, and makes it just taste like I made rice with cream of mushroom sauce and pasta sauce. \n\nThe sandwich wasn't anything spectacular either.

I can't stand acrylic because make my nails look too big and thick, I liked SNS powder but it would break very easily. So I decided to give hard gel a try and I went to LV Nails based on the reviews on Yelp. I was not disappointed! They fit me in same day, I got a full set and pedicure, that was PERFECT, for $100. Now that certainly isn't the cheapest I've ever paid, but you get what you pay for! And it was a very fair price. I've never had a better pedicure than the one I got from LV Nails and Spa. I have odd shaped toenails because when I was younger I used to rip them off rather than cut them down so they grow a little weird and pedicures usually get on my nerves because my entire nail is not painted. Of course it's easily chipped and they neglect the very sides of the nail bed but not here! They have the biggest variety of nail colors in regular polish and hard gel so I had a hard time picking what I wanted but it's a good problem to have! My full set was done by Kim and I can't remember the name of the awesome lady who did my toes, but I definitely want to go to her again! Kim was really professional and sweet. Made sure to ask me if I wanted water a few times, made sure I liked the shape, made sure I liked the color. She made sure to check in with me every step of the way to ensure that I was satisfied. Same with the lady working on my pedicure, made sure to asked me about the length and the color and gave me a really nice foot massage. The salon was really gorgeous very clean and friendly staff with friendly patrons. Parking was not a hassle unlike many other salons I've been too, have to drive around for a few minutes just to find a spot, not here parking was not difficult at all. This is definitely my new go-to salon in the Henderson & Las Vegas area.","date":"2017-03-27 03:31:50"}

I told him several times if I had the money I would get a permanent implant, but I can't afford it so how much to just pull it?\n\nWell, then in walks the finance manager (sounds just like a car dealership) She details all the options from crowns to partials. Thousands of dollars she's quoting. I tell her how much for just pulling the damn tooth.\n\nOK, she explains in order to quote that, since I don't have dental insurance I would have to buy a 1 year dental plan through them that would cost $95. That would entitle me to their \"discount\" procedure rate of $300 to pull the tooth. $300!!! plus the $95 plus the initial $39 and I'm looking at almost $450 to pull a simple tooth!\n\nWell, needless to say I said no.\n\nEven though I paid the $39 (demanded up front when I walked in) which was supposed to include a cleaning and free sonic toothbrush, I was offered and received neither.

So my 4 stars are taking in the assumption that this is what it SHOULD taste like and that is delicious, minus the white tea I drank, but that was my fault.  \n\nThis past Saturday I had hit the West Side Market for some shopping and had brought my wife and our new work friend from India that some met at the Yelp party, Mridul.  We decided to come here because we wanted something unique, quick, and easy on the wallet.  I convinced them by showing Cara's review because the wife loves Pad Thai where I personally have never tried it.  Mridul was limited to chicken, chicken, or chicken so PP (Ha) was right down his alley.\n\nFor the appetizer we tried the PP Spring Rolls (4) and we all thought those were fantastic.  The peanut dipping sauce went perfectly with the fried chicken \/ veggie 'smaller version of egg rolls'.  The wife, as predictable as they come, went with the Spicy Chicken Pad Thai mild heat.  This was spot on.  Very tasty, I mean I could eat this 3 days a week for lunch.  It was weird for me to see the whole dish basically reddish orange with sprinkled peanuts and sprouts because I really couldn't tell the difference between the noodles and the carrots.....again, this is my first time here so I quickly realize what a rookie I was.  Mridul went with the Chicken Fried Rice, medium spice, with a scrambled egg inside.  This was really good too, a dish I would recommend if a rice dish is your desire.  I went with the Spicy Pork Pad Thai medium heat for 2 reasons.   1) I originally wanted the chicken but wifey beat me to it and 2) I wanted to see if there was a noticeable difference between chicken and pork, which upon tasting, there really was.  Although all dishes were great, we all decided that the Spicy Chicken Pad Thai was our favorites.  We also all decided that the heat needed to be upgraded to the medium level, not mild.  \n\nWhat a great first time.  I will be back and also want to try Pad Thai somewhere else to see how it compares.  Very cute place, and really reasonable.  Be forewarned though, they only take cash.","date":"2010-11-22 16:34:58"}

He shows you all your options and will be genuine about what needs to be done and when. He is very compassionate about his work, which reflects upon the impeccable quality of dentistry he provides.

I asked the server if it could be made with flour tortillas instead of corn but she tried arguing with me (her name was Yolanda) that Enchiladas cant be made with flour tortillas because it wont hold together.

Tea is self-serve, there's no real dining space except for two small counters where you will be crowded by the lineup of people looking to fill their appetites with BBQ Pork, chicken, duck, etc. But I don't really care as long as they can keep the cost as low as this!","date":"2009-08-04 17:11:52"}

Totally not what I had expected from the looks of the exterior.  \n\nFrom moderately priced champagnes to ultra high end bordeaux, they have a large variety of great wines.  You can even purchase a bottle and open it on the spot for a $10 corkage fee.  \n\nHad heard the food was good, which is why we came - and I was not disappointed.  Since it was sunday, it was mostly brunch items, but pretty much everything we tried was very tasty.  A few dishes of note:\n\n-Buckwheat crepes: savory crepes are usually salty due to the sauce that's poured on.  Not the case here.  Crepe was soft and tender, with the chicken and mushroom going together nicely, and a light thyme creme sauce to tie it all together.  \n\n-Croque madame: frenchy countryside comfort food.  Love me a good thick piece of bread, and boy, their pain di mie was amazing.  Thick cuts of ham and two gooey over-easy eggs to tie it all together.  Yum.\n\n-Lobster salad croissant: There's something really good about home made pastries and bread.  No corner cutting here.  Fresh lobster meat, mixed with creamy avocado, piled on top of a fresh baked croissant.  \n\nThe kids really dug the lake view and hung around quietly watching the turtles swim around, while the adults ate and socialized.  Overall a great experience.  Highly recommended if you can stomach the drive into the heart of sSummerlin.","date":"2014-06-27 21:35:02"}

The reviews here are mostly good. I had the Tangerine Chicken. I realize that this probably isn't a great dish to review a Chinese place on, however this was rather disappointing. The atmosphere is comfortable and calm. [Most Chinese places I've been to are completely opposite of this] Also for a Saturday night they didn't have many people. [Saturday night is suppose to be a busy night]\n\nSome of the issues I found:\n1. The booths are quite old. If someone is sitting behind you it is very possible for them to push the booth into you. This is quite bothersome, and I had to move because of this reason. \n2. Price, it wasn't that bad. It was about $10 for an entree, nearly $2 for a drink and the meal ended up being $16-17 after tip.\n3. Service: I have no complaints. I'm not very picky on service, so I have no complaints.\n4. Value: For the quality, I wouldn't say the value is very high. They did give a lot of quantity.\n5. The food. This is the thing that bothered me the most. The Tangerine chicken was just chicken. There weren't any vegetables to compliment or to round out the plate. The chicken was chicken battered in tangerine peels, and their batter. Each ball of chicken was [with breading] about 2-3 inches in diameter. The chicken is covered in \"brown sauce.\" The cirtus flavor was only if you had a taste of the fried remains of the tangerine peel. Also, this dish was claimed to be spicy, however from the looks of it, the only spicy element was entire chiles that had been added later to the sauce. \n\nHow could the food have been better. INAPC [I'm not a professional chief], but:\n1. Balance out the dish. Add less deep fried items to the dish. I had never gotten an typical Chinese restr. dish that was deep fried and didn't have some kind of vegetables. \n2. There was NO citrus flavor. If you want the flavor you're going to have to put it in the sauce. It is nearly impossible to favor via the meat via its breading. The chemical reaction completely kills most flavroids. \n3. Don't reuse the sauce. Create a spicy sauce and crush up those peppers. Just putting them in the sauce and heating it up at the last minute won't make it spicy. Add heat to the dish and stick by it. If it says spicy on the menu it should be intended to be spicy.","date":"2011-11-30 05:44:31"}

I arrived at the restaurant at 2:48 pm and stood at the courier pickup counter.  There was a young lady running the register, and a manager with headset delegating tasks to the staff visible from my view point.  The manager walked past me numerous times, hyper focused on bags and monitors and never once glanced at me to make eye contact.  At no point did he even acknowledge my presence.  After 8 minutes of standing there, I finally locked on and said HEY, is the ubereats order ready yet?  \n\nHis response to me was \"You should have spoken up, I can't read your mind\".  This response is the most unprofessional and rude interaction I have ever had at any restaurant while doing deliveries.  This man has clearly no sense of customer service, and the fact that he is a supervisor, with an entire staff of employees within earshot, is a galactic worry.  This is whom they are taking their cues from.  \n\nSo, I will speak up.  Greeting customers and making eye contact with them is the very basic first steps to customer service, across all chains and brands and industries.  And customer service is the business you are in, Mr. Manager.  Your deluded belief that customers should scream at the top of their lungs to get your attention is ridiculous, especially as you've closed yourself off to all interaction by talking loudly in your headset, fidgeting with bags and monitors, and basically ignoring everything human in site.  Don't you think that would intimidate people and make them second guess approaching you?  I have the answer, and the answer is yes.  \n\nI will never again do a food delivery at this location.  I can guarantee you I am not the only one, because often times I am pinged from 10 miles away from this restaurant to do a delivery.  Really?  There's nobody within 10 miles if this place that is willing to go there?  There is a reason!  Corporate needs to take a look at this franchise and consider revoking the license.

It came with crispy bacon, the best breakfast sausage I've ever had, eggs any way you can imagine them, and toasted buttery Brioche. In addition, it came with a breakfast pastry, juice and endless coffee.\n\nThe chocolate croissant was the best chocolate croissant I've ever had, besides of course ones I've made in my pastry career and eaten fresh from the oven. The banana muffin was very moist and very delicious. The coffee was amazing and overflowing. Our waitress constantly warmed and refilled our cups. The service was great. I will be eager to return, next time for dinner!","date":"2011-01-09 04:40:43"}

Also threw some chips and salsa in front of me that alerted the tasted buds that delicious stuff was on the way. Thanks for the heads up, sexy, salty chips!\n\nI ended up with two different margaritas. The first was a passion fruit margarita, which was fine, don't get me wrong, but it was nothing like the next one I had. Whew. Was talking to Michelle, I think that was her name, and she recommended I try the verano de jalisco. I am a huge fan of cilantro and added to this drink it made it fresh and delicious. The unusual salt (can't remember the name) around the rim just made it all the better. Do these!\n\nI then had a side of elotes asados and it was sooooo freaking good. The plate was piled so high I couldn't eat it all. I should have eaten it all because now I want some and I realized how much I wasted.

Way to go, Honest John!\n\nHonest John's interior decorator deserves 5 stars. Love, love, the décor. The brunch menu, while not incredibly big, is also solid. I order the DIY Omelette with almost every \"topping\" option. A few of the items I chose were missing, but it took a decent amount of time to receive our food, and I was starving, so I ate it anyway. It was delicious! I expected it to come with toast or something, but it was just an omelette on a plate. For $11, that's borderline too expensive for just an omelette IMO. I also ordered a side of homefries for $3, which were equally good. Two other things...\n\nWhile our server was pleasant enough, service was slow. Granted, we had a party of six, but the party of three beside us also seemed to experience excessive wait times as well.\n\nIn my 3 short months as a parent this is the first restaurant I've encountered without a changing table. Even though it's been only 3 months, we go out a LOT, so it's interesting that this is the first time this has happened. I sort of just stood there, and after a bit of thought, decided to use my portable changing pad on the entryway bench. Sorry 'bout that, but I didn't want to do it at the table, and wasn't sure what else I could do. Unfortunately, I think this means I won't be dining at HJ's until my baby Yelper is out of diapers, or I fly solo.

Let's just add sex and penis jokes with zombies because people love zombies and sex!\" Who though this would be a good idea? \nTacky middle school penis jokes, unoriginal racist blacks and asian jokes, and overall poor storyline. The host is supposed to carry the show along, but instead I felt he stalled the momentum of the show. There were times I seriously wanted to shout out, \"Get on with it! We get it, they have a penis!'' \nThey poorly incorporated the zombie aspect of it. They created the show around the idea that zombies are hypersexual beings and kept trying to hammer that into the show. Zombies loves sex. Zombies love sex. There, I just told you the whole show. \n\nI honestly couldn't understand the singing. I don't know if it's because of my seat but I had to seriously concentrate to understand what they were singing about, especially the host. Fast talking and slurred singing doesn't make for a good show. I've been to multiple musicals and shows, I've never had to concentrate so hard. The storyline was lost on me. \n\nThe theater is a long rectangle so the seat just continually goes upward instead of outward like most theaters. If you get stuck near the back and at the left end of the row, there's a huge block of wall that juts out blocking your view. You'll have to encroach on the people to your right to get a better view. \n\nThe only good thing about the show was that they had a live band. I'd rather listen to the live band play for 90 minutes than slurred singing and overused sex jokes.","date":"2016-12-19 14:16:49"}

The menu is big enough where there is something for everyone and usually everyone walks away happy. Lately though, the quality of the food as gone way down. \n\nBefore I went vegetarian I used to always get the chicken waldorf salad and it was always so good. I love the blue cheese and the candied walnuts. They were addicting. Since I've become vegetarian I settled on the hummus appetizer, grilled vegetable salad, and the wild mushroom pizza. Recently though, they have completed revamped the menu, adding new items, taking old favorites off. For some places, menu changes mean new and exciting food opportunities and makes the visit to that place even better. Not for CPK. \n\nRecently, since beginning to use yelp, I have wanted to try new places and veer away from old favorites or places that I am used to. However, I tend to have friends and family members who are food-borists... Ya I just invented a new word. A food-borist is someone who never wants to try anything new, and will eat at the same place and order the same exact thing all of the time. My friends are this way. It never fails. Any time one of them has a birthday I get an invitation to eat at CPK and every time I groan. Even before I swore off CPK forever, I was getting extremely tired of it. The second to the last time I went was for my birthday with some friends. I ordered the new roasted vegetable salad and a cup of the vegetarian tortilla soup. I used to love the grilled vegetable salad and was pissed when they replaced it on the menu with roasted vegetable salad. Not good. I struggled through it because my friends paid for my dinner and I didn't want to waste their money. But it was gross, and I vowed never to order it again. The soup was good though. The last time I went was with my sister, husband and niece. This time I ordered the new caramelized peach salad. On the menu, most of the new items sound really good. Its just the execution of them that fails CPK. The peach salad was gross. The peaches were canned and then warmed, and I also saw no caramelization whatsoever. The combination of the peaches with the gorgonzola (my favorite cheese of all time) was so unappetizing. I didn't even get through half of the salad before I said forget it. My husband ordered the garlic cream fettuccine and added sauteed mushrooms and was upset by this as well. The portion size was really small and it was extremely salty. My sister ordered the barbecue cobb salad which was almost entirely jicama. She barely ate half as well because it was just a giant jicama salad! They skimped on all of the other items in the salad and just pretty much covered some jicama in barbecue dressing. \n\nThe pricing at CPK has also become outrageous. It was almost $13 for my salad. For a salad! Does anyone else find that wrong? Considering the ingredients, my salad should have cost $7, tops! Pasta is expensive, pizzas were generally reasonable for awhile but those prices have been raised as well. For such a casual dining place the prices are just exorbitant. The service also sucks. Our waitress probably spent two minutes total the entire meal at our table. No refilled waters, no how is everything. She was just rushing around everyone else's table except ours. \n\nSo we all have made a vow never to return to any CPK. Especially the one in the Chandler Fashion Center. Before I went vegetarian, I got a lovely surprise one morning after eating here and was graced with food poisoning for two days. That was a great experience.","date":"2011-08-24 23:50:01"}

The staff is always friendly and very good at putting you at ease. On the opposite, Dental Depot (Greenway) barely gave me anything more than \"You need thousands of dollars worth of work\", but I could never seem get them to go into detail about what was needed and why without playing 20 questions. They were always confused that I was ready to schedule my next appointment in the office and would tell me to just call when I was ready... I'm... I was... I've missed An Elegant Smile\/Gentle Dental and I'm so glad to be back!

For instance, one time I specifically requested and according to the bill paid the additional fee for bacon to accompany my chocolate chip pancakes, but to my disappointment, no bacon received.\n\nRecently, bf and I decided to treat ourselves to breakfast across the street. It was the first time we actually had the dine in experience. Not impressed! We got there shortly after 9 am to beat the morning rush but the place itself was already so noisy. We could barely hear each other across the table. The majority of the noise, in my opinion, stemmed from the staff talking over each other and calling out across the room for each other. Furthermore, as we witnessed, the waitress was rude to several different customers on occasions. No tact. No quality customer service. Lastly, because of the limited seated capacity of the establishment, by the end of our meal, we were sharing our table with a random gentleman.

Vapiano straddles these distinctions with technology.  Each customer gets a \"credit card\" to track their purchases then pays upon leaving.  Maybe that works better for pizzas and large shared plates, but it is a bit awkward for couples and small groups.  And if you want something else (another drink, dessert, etc.), you have to go re-order at the appropriate counter.  Sort of awkward in my opinion.\n\nVapiano's concept strongly emphasizes interior design - it even says so on their web page.  And while that is all well and good, two true tests of a restaurant are the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the environment.  Vapiano scores moderately well on the food (slightly better than average Italian), but falters significantly on cleanliness.\n\nAfter my food was prepared, I took the tray to a nearby table.  I placed the tray down and noticed there were very small winged insects crawling on the table.  Not sure what they were - really small termites or large aphids?  Bugs and food - not a good combination!  So I changed table two more times and still there were bugs on the tables.  Maybe they were there because of the plants in the restaurant?  I don't know, but since I already had my food, I chose the \"least buggy\" table and finished my meal as quickly as I could.  Guess it could be at least as buggy as sitting outside or having a picnic?  The moderate mid-week crowd that was there seemed to not notice this problem.\n\nThe last table I selected was along the left-side of the restaurant, where there are long white drapes made of a sort of gauzy material.  The drapes hang down to almost table surface height and the tables are perpendicular to the windows.  Well, you can guess what comes next - looking at the drapes, you can easily see that they were absolutely filthy, stained by who-knows-how-many previous meals.  While pasta and marinara sauce can be a bit messy, whoever thought to put white drapes next to a table surface wasn't much of a designer.  A simple solution would have been to rotate the tables 90-degrees so they were parallel with the drapes - harder to stain that way.  Another good solution - replace the drapes with clean ones, or remove them altogether!\n\nAs I left to pay, the hostess asked me how my meal was.  I mentioned the bugs and stains, but she seemed oblivious to this.  Had she heard it before?  Did she not care?  I paid and left.\n\nInsects and a dirty environment are a deadly combination for future success.  This location needs to get its act together - get rid of the tiny little buggers and clean the drapes.\n\nI give this Vapiano location 3 stars (average) for food, but ZERO stars for cleanliness.","date":"2013-07-12 22:29:06"}

After a fun afternoon of day drinking my boyfriend and I decided we needed to fill our bellies with delicious pho and drunken noodles. I've been wanting to try this place because of the Yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint. We were greeted by the owner and a very friendly order taker (Leslie). We were sad to find out they had just run out of broth for the pho and were also out of the drunk AF noodles. However, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise because we ended up trying a variety of other equally delicious foods.  \n\nFirst up we ordered The Big Wang and it was awesome.  It came on a huge baguette and was loaded with strips of tender beef, cucumbers, a spicy (but not too spicy) Wang sauce), and Asian slaw. Side note: The Big Wang was listed as the top 11 best sandwiches you must try in Nevada. I can see why, seriously!\n\nI wanted to try the Bang Bang Sliders and figured they would be little appetizer sized. Umm wrong, they were HUGE! Set between soft pretzel bread these sliders were overflowing with tender pulled pork, siam slaw, cukes and onions, and that tasty Wang sauce. You get 3 large sliders so plenty to take home.\n\nLeslie recommended the Bangkok Burrito and we thought hey why not? Another excellent choice. This monstrously huge burrito came stuffed with curry chicken, chicken fat rice, and bamboo shoots. Again we could only eat about a third of it and in the take out box the rest went.  \n\nWe were brought an order of Dirty chips on the house since they were out of the Pho and Drunk AF noodles.  They were like Asian nachos, were delicious, and we ate the whole damn thing with no apologies. Leslie also brought us samples of the homemade ice cream. My boyfriend liked the cereal milk flavor the best but passion fruit was my favorite. Total bill came to $38 but we easily got 2 meals out the deal. We're definitely coming back to try the Pho and drunken noodles soon! Like as in tomorrow.\n\nThis place really is \"Phoking\" Phonomenal!!","date":"2017-01-27 19:50:27"}

Cute little shop with seating off to the left. The employees were not friendly nor rude. They were just... there. However, the lady who brought out our to-go bag was really nice. Most of the ice cream flavors were \"OUT\" (written in chalk on their massive menu board). This was 2 hours before closing so that might have had something to do with it. Still, there were some flavors that I would have loved to try but was unable to and that was disappointing.\n\nThey have metal spoons for the ice cream samples - that was unique and something I've never seen before.\n\nSampled the Turkish Coffee and French Toast ice cream, both were yummy but the french toast won (hands down!!!).\n\nI just realized that I wasn't offered the little \"sample\" scoop on top of my french toast ice cream. I'll be sure to ask for it when I go next time. Seems kind of odd that I have to ask though. If that's their \"thing\", they should offer it to every customer, each time ice cream is ordered. Oh well.\n\nMy husband and I also bought fries. He ordered the cheddar bacon fries - pretty tasty with lots of cheese and bacon bits and 1 side of ranch.\n\nI ordered the chicken tenders and fries which came with 1 side of honey mustard (which tasted more like mustard with a hint of honey). A boring and safe choice and it tasted, well... boring and safe.\n\nThe fries are rather expensive for what they are though. The pictures of the pizza fries look good but the price, along with it being extra $$$ for pepperoni (wth?), I will surely pass.\n\nI will most likely make my way back for the ice cream, but not for the fries unless I'm starving and nothing else around seems appetizing.

After hearing from my employer and his brother-in-law that it was not such a great place, that disappointment faded.\n\nI decided to visit Bar Louie in early November while I was at Tempe Marketplace to watch a movie. I walked through the front door and was not greeted by either a hostess or any other employee. I traipsed toward the bar and was also not greeted by either of the two bartenders behind the bar. I continued forward and finally found a nice young lady whom I asked about seating. She retrieved a server and I requested to be sat on the patio. The patio was empty and I chose a corner table. My waiter informed me that he would be right back and would bring me a menu.\n\nAfter bringing a menu back, I inquired as to whether or not there were any beer specials ongoing. I was dismayed to find out that their refrigeration system was on the fritz and they only had three beers available: New Castle Brown Ale and two run-of-the-mill, piss-poor domestics. I chose the New Castle.\n\nAfter receiving my drink, I ordered from their very straightforward menu after asking the server what his personal favorite menu item was. The \"Four Tacos Plato\" with blackened fish was selected, and off went the server.\n\nI received my food in a very timely manner and it was piping hot. Everything tasted fresh and it looked well-constructed.\n\nMy only complaint was the portion size. The tacos were listed under the \"Large Plate\" section of the menu, but the tacos themselves were quite small. They were more reminiscent of street tacos as opposed to restaurant fare. Regardless, the service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable, the food was quite good and the atmosphere (at least from where I was sitting; on the outside looking in) seemed warm.\n\nAll-in-all, I can recommend it to others, but I can't say that it is a five-star establishment.","date":"2012-12-05 04:23:36"}

My parents and I went in today to pick up an order of undhia and bhajia at 6pm. They had pre-ordered it and arranged the pick up time. We were told to wait for 5 minutes, which we did with no problem. 5 minutes turned into 10, 15, and almost 20. When it finally came out my father rightly expressed concern about the timing since we were ordering a very large amount for a special event. The owner snidely replied, well, if you are so concerned, then why are you even ordering from us? \nUmmm, say what? \nFirst rule of customer service, the customer is always right. And even if they are obnoxious, which we were not, you APOLOGIZE for being late. And you don't make snide comments. \nAnd here's the kicker, we let it slide because there were other people in the store, and when we got home we realized we had gotten the WRONG order, we had 2 orders of bhajias. So we called the owner, Hetal, to note this error. Instead of an apology (at this point we were owed two) we got her adamant denial that she was in the wrong. No, it was us who had placed a wrong order. My father expressed his disapproval of her behavior and you know what she said? I don't have to listen to you, I've opened restaurants before, I don't need to be told how to run it. \nUM, actually, you do. Because you are RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL, and cocky enough to think that just because your food is good, you can get by with the worst service I have ever encountered. This is America, you can't treat your customers like this and get away with it. \nAnd it's such a shame, because in this small indian community of Charlotte, one wants to spread the word about their fellow indian's business and help them out.

Do they understand what they are doing to these other women, who are someone's sister, daughter, mother?\n\nWalking down the Strip at night, I pray for humanity.   \n\nIn the morning, it's actually pretty nice though and a good place for a run.","date":"2014-09-25 11:53:32"}

The chopped turkey & feta salad is what I had today.  I had them add asparagus, which was a great call if I may say so myself!  The large salad and fresh roll is the perfect lunch... fresh, filling, healthy enough, and pretty inexpensive when it comes to designer salads around town.  I also like the spinach, pancetta & goat cheese and the veggie & aged parmesan salads.  \n\nMy husband eats at Sauce often as well... he goes for a salad or sandwich.  Last time we were there together, he had the salami, turkey, prosciutto & mozzarella panini.  I had a bite and was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice balance of thin sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and tangy red wine vinegar in between two perfectly grilled pieces of bread.  The thin crust pizzas are pretty decent also.  Depending on your appetite, sharing a pizza and a salad with your companion can work out to be a satisfactory meal... \n\nWhat I like about Sauce the most? Fast, friendly, and efficient service in a clean and casual environment.  The moderate pricing is also a big plus in my book... especially in this economy.","date":"2010-01-08 04:14:57"}

After another 5 minutes I decided it wasn't worth my time to wait around, it didn't seem like anyone cared that I was there. My second experience I actually got an appointment but the lady was snippy because we were a few minutes late. Ok fine, sorry I was a little late, but this set my two year old off on the wrong foot. We want this to be a positive experience for him and are expecting that out of a children's salon. He could totally read her negativity and was afraid to get in the chair, normally he is very good about haircuts. My third and final attempt to go to Little Snips I made an appointment and showed up on time only to discover a closed sign on the door. The sign said \"will return at 1\", my appointment was for 12:30. Luckily instead of just waiting I decided to call and the message on the answering machine said they decided to close for the day due to weather. Thanks a lot for calling and letting me know!!! I had no problem loading up my two kids and making it there on time, so I really don't understand why they closed.

I could hear people walking in their room on third floor a couple of times.\nThe thing that was a surprise as far as noise were the trains that went through in the wee hours of the morning. We had arrived after dark and didn't notice that a railway crossing was right outside our window one story down, and at least twice trains went by and blew their horns a few toots as they passed the intersection.\nWe had some drinks, including complimentary ones for our stay, at the Up North, and the bartender told us we could take drinks and popcorn up to the room if we would like.\nThe Hotel Ruby Marie was a charming stay and I would stay again if I were looking to spend some time in the area.","date":"2015-01-18 15:02:00"}

The food was incredible, the drinks were strong and remarkably tasty, and the feeling at the restaurant was just very upbeat and lively.  To begin we had wine and a bourbon based pre made cocktail. I really liked the ingenuity of the cocktail where you're given a bottle instead of having to wait for the crafting each time. We then had the tuna cones, mushroom flatbread, and the brussel sprout salad. The ahi cones had a nice kick with the sauce and the presentation was awesome. The flatbread had more of a pizza feel than your typical flatbread which I enjoyed tremendously. The brussel spirit salad was a nice side with whole pieces of bacon and apple rather than sprinkled as per usual. I like this heartier rendition better. The ambiance of the bar is really nice and the staff were great. I really wish I had a casual bar like this closer to my house on the west side.

We were in town for an event at the Convention Center. \n\nPros:\nFriendliness of the staff! From check in to check out, they were unbelievably accommodating and friendly. \n\nAmenities in the room. Full kitchen (which is the reason we booked there to begin with. A lot of places in Vegas do not have a kitchen). It had a sink, fridge, toaster, stove top, tea kettle, microwave, Keurig coffee maker, and cabinets. As a nice touch, they had Rio Blend coffee in the room. Maybe because of the 2016 Olympics coming up? Also had paper coffee cups, sweeteners, creamer cups, and stirring sticks. Due to county regulations, they are not allowed to keep plates, silverware, etc in the room but will bring them to your room if needed. \n\nThey also included an iron, ironing board, blow dryer, light up mirror, bathrobe, and plenty of fluffy towels. \n\nThe bathroom has a TV inside the mirror. Didn't use it but interesting touch. Spa tub and separate shower. Marble counters and floors. Water heated up VERY quickly. \n\nThe pillows!!! Oh the pillows! I have to find the Downrite brand online or in Macy's or something because they were divine. Beds were comfy too. \n\nOur room even had a DOORBELL on it instead of the bellboy knocking, he rang a door bell! LOL\n\nThe AC was amazing and cooled the room quickly and kept it cool. \n\nVery quiet. We never once heard any other guests. All the appliances in the room were quiet as well. \n\nThe elevators. Fast. Ya know how some hotels you stand there forever waiting on the elevator? Not here. I timed it. It took 13 seconds to get from the 39th floor to the lobby. Unreal. \n\nThe ice machines are in their own little rooms in the hallways so you don't have to listen to someone getting ice in the middle of the night. \n\nIt is right across from a huge mall. Lots of shops and a large food court. \n\nCons:\n\nThe train. Yes, you read that correctly. There was a train that ran behind the hotel where our room was facing that ran every couple of hours throughout the night and woke us up each time. As it came up to an intersection, it would blow its horn over and over. But this is where the nice staff came in handy. They were more than willing and helpful to move us to a room facing The Strip in exchange for a small extra fee because it was a room facing The Strip. We could still hear the train in the distance but not enough to wake us up. We only heard it before heading to bed. \n\nValet. Yes, I know that valet was supposed to be bougie and helpful, however, we found it bothersome. It's just easier to have access to our car when needed. On the other hand there was a relatively short wait time so it wasn't too bad. However, that depends on your timing. Some times of the day were very busy. \n\nInternet. It was a bit slow. So if you are someone there on business who needs fast internet for work, this may become an issue. \n\nSleeper sofa. We pulled out the sleep sofa that our original room included. For a 5 star place, there should be a nicer one. It was just your run of the mill, feel every spring, mattress. \n\nNo casino. For me personally, this was not a problem but if you going to Vegas to gamble, this may be an issue for you. \n\nNot on The Strip. The only reason this is a issue is because of the heat. If you want to go out and walk The Strip, you also have to add to that walk because you have to get from the hotel to Las Vegas Blvd. It's not too far but the heat is what does it. \n\nI may not agree on his politics but his hotel was top notch.

I had a dealine because the car will be shipped to Europe and I was to leave on the second day the car was at Napa. \n\nDay one part for my car did not arrive on time. Day 2, Steve the location manager went himself in the morning of day 2 to get the headgasket. The guys are friendly and trying hard, but seems like they are not good in handling imports. After the headgasket component was installed they basically couldn't set up the factory settings. So I had to call a tow truck and ship it to my dealer, who will be taking care of completing the last step.

I think I started another review like this already, but really -- I stopped in here because the hubs and I were checking out of the Golden Nugget, and it's right past one of their checkin\/out desks.  Looks super fancy.  I thought everything would be crazy pricey (super cute + Vegas = $$$ to me), but surprisingly, their ginormous cupcakes were just $3!! And their chocolate-dipped macaroons (or sans-chocolate, same price) were ... shoot, incredibly affordable is all I remember.  AND, it's not like these macaroons were *just* dipped in chocolate either -- I saved these as a treat for myself, rather than sharing them with my friends who were celebrating the big 3-0 (I'm a fab friend, what can I say), and it was like a truffle was stuck to the bottom of those macaroons, talk about a delightful surprise!  Honestly, I don't have much experience with macaroons other than visual, but the softness and coconuttiness (not too much) were very appealing.  And back to those cupcakes -- huge.  Delicious. I got one red velvet for one friend, who shared a bite with me -- moist, tasty, cream cheese frosting was perfect.  I carted around the other two cupcakes for the rest of the trip, and only got to sample the chocolate-chocolate -- also delish.  \n\nNutshell: if you're nearby (ie, downtown), worth the stop.  Would I make a special trip downtown just for these? Despite the 4 stars, I can't in all honesty recommend the hassle it is to get downtown if you're staying on the Strip for a short time.

I doubt seriously that it was freshly made - thinking it had been sitting around for a while.  \nOur pastitsio was ok - not very hot when served though, my guess is that it was microwaved.  Our pasta (ziti)  was the worst we've had in a restaurant ever - in that it was SO overdone.  Normally, if a dish isn't perfect , we will not ask for a replacement, but this was luke warm and SO mushy and starchy and tasteless. The server explained something that I really didn't want to know - that the pasta is precooked at the beginning of the day and then reheated ! - not cooked to order.  Our server was accomodating, but the whole experience was much less than wonderful.  While we expect ethnic music in an ethnic restaurant, theirs was so loud that after a couple times around the play list we were really quite ready to leave and had our 2nd plate of ziti (only slightly less mushy) packaged to go.  a big disappointment - glad we had a groupon.  BUT - it turns out that our server's insistance that the groupon required us to order two entrees (rather than the mix of soup\/salad and one entree we'd planned to order) was NOT true. We didn't have the groupon with us - only on my phone and I didn't look closely at it until I got home and looked at it more closely on my lap  top. SO that less than hot, overdone ziti was the dish that we actually didn't plan to order - but we had to, and that pushed our lunch order over the $30 limit of the groupon -- just an overall bad lunch experience - after a previous lunch there which was much better.","date":"2015-12-05 04:06:49"}

I was all wrong about you! I am so happy that I decided to give you a second chance, and you beyond redeemed yourself! If you read my first review I didn't have such a stellar experience, It wasn't bad per say but it wasn't what I was expecting! So, I was hoping that the second time around would be better and it was!\n\nThis time around we went and ordered another bottle of my now favorite wine Sexual Chocolate, it's a Syrah - Zinfandel blend and it's frankly to die for. The bottle runs around $65.00 and they offer it by the glass as well at I believe $16.00.  This go around we decided to order an assortment of their appetizers, and I was frankly blown away by nearly all of them. The only one I wouldn't order again would be the Spicy Tuna Pops. The tuna itself was amazing, super fresh and really flavorful. The waffle cone that it arrived in didn't exactly compliment the fish. \n\nOther items that we ordered and LOVED were the dozen oysters, we got an assortment of the oysters they had that particular day and they were fresh and this time around there wasn't a trace of shell in any of the oysters! WOOHOO!\n\nThe Crispy Cuttlefish was one of my fav items that evening - The only way to describe it is that it is very similar to calamari but frankly it's better than calamari. It doesn't have that rubbery texture to it and it was fried to perfection and the lemon aioli was the perfect compliment to it. \n\nCuttlefish's take on a wedge salad is what dreams are made of! I love wedge salads but I usually am not a huge fan of the iceberg lettuce since it really has zero taste or nutritional value to it. The bibb lettuce was a welcome change of pace and the crispy pancetta, and avocado was a nice  addition. \n\nThe pork  belly, the Carlsbad Mussels, Shrimp and grits I could just go on and on! Had the opportunity to meet Joey one of the owners who was very friendly, and I was really impressed when I learned that he actually cooks in the kitchen there. I love that he is a hands on owner and it shows that he has a real investment in the establishment! \n\nDef worth checking out if your in the mood for some fabulous seafood, and if you love oysters and champagne Wednesday's are 1\/2 priced oysters and champagne nights and they had some great live music!","date":"2014-06-11 19:47:59"}

Did not pawn us off on the bar, but instead asked if we wanted to sit inside or out. We picked inside. Outside had nice variety of tables and a nice open fire, great \"foody\" smell that really drew you in. Once seated, team member came over with glasses and poured water for us. Menu was great, server came over and noted the allergy and went through the menu with my with my wife and discussed substitution options. Great drink menu, good selection. Great timing of appetizers and entrees. My wife had the salmon rillettes, which were absolutely delicious. She also had the cast iron petite chicken (with mashed potatoes instead of the stuffing). Great presentation, chicken cooked perfectly, great flavors. Best mashed potatoes that I have ever had in a restaurant. I had the beckett's table signature fork tender short ribs. Also got a side of the wood oven roasted bacon biscuit stuffing. All I can say is WOW... Truly fork tender, and truly awesome. I love stuffing, sad but true. This was the best stuffing that I have ever had. Presentation was perfect, stuffing side came in a small cast iron dish. Nice little aside, there are pig figurines throughout the restaurant.

Besides, it takes us time to write this.\nTWC, or Road Runners ( they were the same ) was the supplier of cable internet for Earth Link (I was told later) when I called for connection problem.  TWC convinced me to change  from Earth Link to TWC.  I refused the first year for TWC's bad  business integrity.  Few years later, I had no choice as the price went up again.  So I switched to TWC. The second year, it went up that understood, after promotion.  To save trouble of payment, I set up auto- pay, this year it went up again.  I called to understand the reason.  Their customer service was so rude with a prima donna attitude.  She even insulted me over the phone as I didn't want all the services. Since I stayed for a week of less each month, it's unjustified for me to pay close to $100.  I simply kept my expenses but the service reduced to 1\/10 of the speed that I had.  I'm looking for another provider if there is. \nFor all these years, I've seen more adverse comments than favorable comments to TWC.  Most business respect prestige customers or those stay with them for years. But not TWC.  They believe customers can't live without them in Charlotte.  That's why I've seen salesmen knocking at our doors every season like the 50s to look for new customers.\nI'm sure if TWC's upper management can make a change to their customer services or change their prima donna attitude, I'm sure they will not loss customers.\nAnyway, sorry for my long comments.

But when there are so many other good veggie options out there, why bother.","date":"2015-05-26 12:42:03"}

This places is straight fire! I'm not just talking about heat levels either. We got a small sampler in which we tried the fried chicken with green onion, blazing chicken on a skillet with sausages and an order of kimchi and oyster fried rice. The fried chicken was so crisp it was unreal. The meat was still moist and succulent. The flaming chicken was tasty, well-spiced and flavourful too. The sausages weren't the main event so I give some leeway on their generic processed feel. The fried rice was also excellent, a little stingy on the oysters, but to be expected. Overall I'm definitely coming back for the fried chicken - it makes a nice alternative to chicken wings and beer. Just a heads up though, don't expect late night Chinese food prices, this place isn't cheap.","date":"2016-03-07 00:13:27"}

My favorite dishes were the seafood dumplings with spinach and the fish noodles with mushrooms. Mind you that the fish noodles were not in their menu.

Having lived in the valley for most of my life I appreciate the sentimentality.  \n\nBUT!  It is important to separate nostalgia from reality, especially when others rely on your opinion when making dinner plans.\n\nI've lived in the Valley for a good long time- more than 40 years.  I've been to Jordan's more times than I can count.  \n\nAs a child, this was one of many local Mexican food restaurants we visited- others being El Maya, Don Jose's, Rosa's, Rosita's, George's Ole, and others.  As an adult, part of my enjoyment was the old-fashioned, retro atmosphere- the genuine Naugahyde seats, dark wrought iron, old-school environment.  I was even OK with the smooth taco sauce in lieu of chopped and chunky salsa.  I tend to stick with the old-school combo plate- taco, enchilada, tostada type combos when I visit.\n\nMy last two visits have occurred in the last year- most recently in November.  The experiences were almost identical- disappointing.  It was as if someone in the kitchen had just given up.  The taco meat was not really seasoned, very bland, and the shell tasted as if they went and picked up a package at the grocery instead of making their own.  The enchilada was rather oily.  Food was warm, not hot.  Service was friendly but scarce- my drink sat empty more than once.\n\nThe visit in November is likely my last.  I drive by this location at least 3 times a week, and remember wistfully the days when the the food was piping hot, shredded beef well seasoned and the entire taco fresh out of the cooker- crispy and delicious.   There are too many good Mexican food places in town, and even for the memories that walking into this places conjures up, I cannot see myself coming back anytime soon.  I'll keep my eyes open for an upturn in Yelp reviews, particularly from those who are trying it for the first time.\n\nAs another reviewer said- be forewarned.  You run a great risk of being disappointed.","date":"2011-02-13 22:12:41"}

Being an ASU alum, I frequented the Tempe location, and it was one of the most unique and fun bars near campus. The atmosphere in Scottsdale is similar, despite being in one of the north side's more complicated and ginormous strip centers. They've clearly taken a design tip from the Tempe spot, with brick walls, similar lighting and bar and a decent-sized patio out front (not nearly the size of Tempe's, but oh well).

The table was wobbly, but the server (busboy?) immediately got down on his knees and readjusted the ends for us.\n\nWe started out with the cheddar bites.  They were mini, dense and rather not great.  Its almost like a failure attempt at recreating Red Lobster's cheddar biscuits.  The shrimp and grits were decent, but a far cry from NOLA.  The meat and potatoes were decent, but really average if that.  The duck fat fries were actually pretty good and the only thing we all agreed was tasty.  Too bad the waiter took it away before we were done while talking to another server so we couldn't even protest.\n\nThe reasons for the 2 stars - the dishes are creative, the menu is mysterious (which is good and bad), and there was such hope there.  These were the kinds of dishes that you might see on Master Chef or Hell's Kitchen.  But they wouldn't be winners by any means.  \n\nThe place is kept COLD.  We were near the vents, but still, by the time our food reached our table, they were lukewarm at best.\n\nAll in all, the service was inconsistent and the food is mediocre at best.

The scallops in pesto - over powering and the oil tastes stale. The octopus - grilled perfectly but the tabuleh and humus and pomegranate - too much and not well done. The tuna - served on seaweed salad....doesn't fit on the same plate as pickerel with sweet mash....very confusing and very strong flavours.\n\nBut what they do right are the classics. Great deal on Oysters - though i found the shucking to be a little poor - but when you're paying essentially $1.50 a shuck, you accept that.  The lavraki however - now this is the star of their menu. It's exceptional. No confusion - classic greek prepartion - the gril, some salt, some lemon and olive oil. The protein sings and the grill accents. \n\nMy honest recommendation - just go for some oysters and lavraki and you'll have an excellent night.

It was definitely a bit more than I'd usually pay for trays of meats, cheeses, and the like, but I chalked this up to a wedding expense and didn't think much of it.\n\nCome the day of the wedding, I was happy hitched and getting photos taken when I get a call \"Hi, this is SoAndSo from Metcalfe's and I have a delivery.\" \"Yes,\" I say. \"I'm the bride and I'm not there. There are 2 planners on site as well as venue staff.\" \"But I'm at the back door and no one is here. I have a delivery,\" says Metcalfe's dude. \"I'm not there! I've just gotten married. I'm having my pictures taken. Please just go knock on the front door. There are a bunch of people who can help you.\" \"Yeah, I went to the front door, but it says {the venue} is closed for a private event.\" *FACEPALM* Now I was annoyed. \"YES! And YOU ARE BRINGING THE APPETIZERS!\" I then just snapped a bit and told him to sort it out and that I wasn't to be bothered.\n\nLater (perhaps 20-30 minutes later) we parked our car at the venue for more photo taking and the delivery van from Metcalfe's was just leaving. I got a dirty look.  When I later spoke to the person managing the venue for our reception, he had a laughable mention about the delivery guy as well. Clearly the dude was not a people person and very confused about how to deliver to an event (as opposed to a person's house, etc.).\n\nThe food was good, but didn't have labels as to what it was. I'd asked about this and was told it would have. So our very expensive platter of Wisconsin artisanal cheeses and dried fruits and such didn't get eaten as much as it might have. That thing was *not* inexpensive. I was a bit miffed. \n\nAll in all, the appetizers from Metcalfe's were delicious. But the service was ridiculous.","date":"2012-11-06 17:29:26"}

They were stuffed mostly with lettuce and had little to no flavor., and we tried 3 different kinds. The peanut sauce was overly thick and cloyingly sweet and added nothing positive to the rolls.\n\nI had the Lemon Grass Chicken for dinner.

Ambiance is lovely and rustic. The concept is terrific (farm to table), too. The service--I had a very professional and friendly mid-aged man--was also very knowledgeable and attentive. One of my party (a visiting professor) put up a mild huff about how the wine \"not being cold enough\" (something my cheap ass would probably let go from the get-go), but he handled it with aplomb. We got multiple dishes, including a cheese and bread tray, eggplant parm, some sort or cheesy kimchi thing, and another kind of braised beef. All were fresh and mouth-watering to the eyes. And the wine selection was fantastic. My only complaint--and it's enough to knock off a star--is that the food was just to darn salty. You had to drown out many of the dishes with the extra bread on the table. It's possible most of V Picasso's regular patrons like their food on the extra salty side, but I as well as my other dinner mates agree that you couldn't eat too much of the food because of the salt content. So that was a big disappointment, particularly given that everything else was spades. So if they can just cut back on the salt, maybe they're be on the track to 4 (hell even 5 stars) in my book. But until then... one can only hope and wait.","date":"2017-10-24 20:00:38"}

I guess that depends on your definition of typical.  Sam's club has hours just for buisness members starting at 7:00am.  You can also fax in or go online and have them shop for you.  All you do is go in a pay for it.\n\nThey have a few membership levels- Business, Gold Member and Premium.  The Premium level you earn 2% back on all your purchases.  They do give you two cards for the price that you pay, so you can go in with a neighbor and each get a card.\n\nIn addition to electronics, photo lab, optical center, bakery, meat department, they also have a little know \"clearance\" section at each Sam's.  You just have to know where it is.  Also when they are clearancing out merchandise, the price will end in a \"1\".  Most common is .71 or .81.  I have picked up 5 pound bags of mixed candy for .71 a bag, and lots of other deals just by knowing this little secret.\n\nThey do discount their meat the day before they need to pull it from the shelves.  They also will give cookies to children.\n\nMy boys also love the cafe where they get their \"pizza and drink please.\"  Their menu has changed  a lot lately though and I am not sure if I like it.  Prices are very reasonable though.\n\nThey also have gasoline pumps outside which if you know your prices can be a good thing!\n\nIf you are not satified with your membership, you can cancel at anytime and they will prorate your membership refund.

For dinner, I ordered their famous mac and cheese with short ribs. Everyone at the table had a bite of my dish because it was incredible. It wasn't overwhelmingly tasty like other mac and cheese dishes. The pasta was cooked perfectly and served in an iron  skillet. You can order their burgers or sandwiches and upgrade your side to a mac and cheese or pozole for just $3. So worth it! My boyfriend always orders the pozole. I am not a fan of pozole in general but The Vig makes it so well. \n\nFor drinks, our server misunderstood my order and gave me a Four peaks peach ale instead of the AZ peach shandy.

This is a review of just the front office staff.  I was asked to come to my 10:15 appointment 30 minutes early to fill out the necessary me patient forms.  I arrived 55 minutes early.  Provided my ID and insurance card then day to complete my ppwk.  After I finished I went to turn it in.   The girl in the front glanced at it and told me(rather rudely) I had to fill out the insurance portion.  I said to her that I thought that was why they took a copy of my card.  She gave me a funny look and said you have to fill it out.  I took the forms back and walking away I muttered.... that's a pain in the ass.  After completing them I handed them back to her and she said they'd call me.  About 10 min later I was called by a different lady to pay my Co pay.  As I was talking to the new lady the ride one interrupted our conversation by saying that I'm not allowed to swear in here, that kind of language isn't permitted.  Lol I'm sure I looked at her crazy because honestly I had forgotten that I even said anything since it wasn't directed at her.  I asked what I said and she said you called me a pain in the ass.  I told her I want talking to her and that comment was more to myself.  She replied with you're not allowed to talk like that.  At this point I'm getting irritated because I honestly wasn't talking to her and I had explained that,  so I told her... generally speaking if I were going to ball someone a pain in the ass I would look them in the face and straight up tell them that they are a f#%#ing pain in the ass.  Then I sat down.  Needless to say, this was not the best 1st impression they could've made on me.","date":"2015-05-26 17:42:41"}

Sitting next to a flat screen playing college basketball doesn't scream fine dining. But maybe that's my fault b\/c the rest of this review is positive. Our food was cooked very well. Great flavors and selection (meatless friendly options, etc.). I had the delicious sea scallops in lobster sauce (I only got three though). I think I would have preferred traditional gnocchi as opposed to the semolina, they were a bit doughy. But they did soak up the sauce well, so maybe that's why, obviously Zack Bruell knows more than I do. My wife liked her risotto. The service was professional. But for the price there are better Italian options not far away.","date":"2017-02-19 13:58:11"}

I had a particular design in mind this visit which included some intricate straight lines. \nThe technician tried her best to draw the lines, but I was surprised the tools that she used, instead of a thin brush like I have seen used in other salons I've been to, she used a bulky thick brush. So all the lines came out thick, uneven, and wavy. I didn't really like it, but it was late and I didn't want to make a fuss. After a day, the lines really started to bother me, so I called to see if they would fix it being that I was charged $14 for design on 4 out of my 10 nails. On top of the manicure being $10 more than other salons, $14 for design, and leaving a 20% tip, they told me, they would charge me for fixing the nails. It's not about the money, obviously I spend money to get me nails done. It's about the lack of customer service that they offered. Think twice before going to this over priced salon that lacks good customer service and just wants your money. \n\n\nThanks for actually responding on Yelp. However, it would've been nice to actually get this over the phone when I called, instead I was told there was nothing you could do, except charge me. The lines were thick and wavy, maybe you need to look closely at the picture to see that. As far as your 7-day policy, I called the very next day, so I'm not sure how that's comes into play. \nI ok'd the design cause we were already 2 1\/2 hours in and like I said prior, I didn't want to make a fuss. \nMy problem wasn't with the tech, she did a great job, besides the lines. My problem was with the management  not caring that I was displeased with my nails after 1 day and after dropping $70 in their salon. \nThey treated me like I was trying to get something for free. If they had said, why don't you come in so we can take a look. Who knows I probably would've paid to get it fixed. But they didn't want to hear my side of the story. I love having my nails done, and always receive compliments on them daily. In turn I love to refer folks to the salons I visit to so they too can have that experience. But the way I was treated at this salon was unnecessary, so I had to address it. I wish The Nail Room much success.","date":"2016-01-30 02:19:51"}

There is only one other table with people at it in the whole restaurant. The waitress is extremely inattentive and seems to have zero care for her table.

I was quickly seated, ordered the half regular, half spicy hot pot, and went to gather my food while the broth came to a boil. \n\nI was very impressed with the variety, especially the seafood: 3 different types of crab, scallops, clams, mussels, and even lobster. Not sure if the seafood variety is like this every night or I just happened to visit on a special day. A selection of noodles, vegetables, and meats (beef, chicken, pork, and lamb) rounded out my choices. Each of the refrigerated items were portioned out on Styrofoam plates and wrapped in cellophane, which I thought was a little wasteful. In the center of the restaurant were a bunch of desserts and some cooked items such as fried rice, pad thai, etc. The theme of the non-refrigerated items was thai. As mentioned by others, there was also a condiment\/sauce section.\n\nBoth broths were fine. The spicy broth was not that spicy and did not cause any numbness, but nor was it very oily. The meats were just okay, very lean, so they ended up a little tough after cooking. The lamb (a classic) and beef (eye of round?) were my favorites. I am not a huge crustacean fan, especially if I have to shell them myself, but I did enjoy the shellfish. The desserts were okay, nothing special. The meats could have used a little more marbling and an extra waitperson would have helpful.","date":"2014-11-30 00:00:05"}

Honestly, some people might not be excited about the \"inconvenience\" about ordering multiple times but I'm happy with it because I've oftentimes wondered and reflected about the waste! Also, the waiters\/waitresses are so attentive that anytime you need anything, they're right there to take your order. Furthermore, they do all the cooking for you, so all you need to do is eat. The only thing that I wasn't crazy about was the fact that the price per person is already pretty steep. It seems a little ridiculous to have to pay an additional amount for some of the meats.

It comes with 2 scoops of Belgian Chocolate (you can choose other flavors if you please), whipped cream, hot fudge, and topped with a toasted marshmallow and sprinkles. Gotta have the sprinkles.

I have been going to this location for over 20 years and the line never moved as slowly as it did today. There were very few people in line when I walked in but it was quite a while before anyone asked for my order. Both the people in front of me and behind me in line commented they had also never seen the line move so slowly, and they were also long-time customers.\n\nI tried to figure it out since I counted five staff members on the line; one on the grill, one handling drinks and shakes (which left her just standing there most of the time), one putting the condiments on the orders, one at the register, and one handling the fries and onion rings. The only thing I could think of was the staff was new. One person looked vaguely familiar but other than that I didn't recognize anyone, and another person said \"I've never seen these people before.\" The employees weren't horsing around; everything just moved very, very slowly.\n\nBecause I drove in from so far away I hung in there until I got my order, but if I lived closer I would have been long gone.  I don't like downgrading my initial positive review but I think management needs to be aware they have a customer service issue--at least they had one today around 6:00-7:00 p.m.\n\n......................................................................\nTed's in Tempe has been a favorite of mine since the early 90's.  Though currently residing in Queen Creek, it's worth the trip now and then for a delicious, charbroiled jumbo all beef dog.  So many places come and go, but it's great that Ted's has been at the same location for years. Hope they remain for a long, long time.\n\n11\/8\/09: Found myself at Ted's again today [along with a few other times since posting this review].  Same great dogs, and this time got the fries and onion rings--so good. Same quick service too. So glad to see their business is booming during these less-than-great economic times. Long Live Ted's !!!\n\n01\/07\/2014 - Ted's still delivers the goods. Since I live in San Tan Valley now (we formerly borrowed Queen Creek's name) I don't get out there often, though have been there a few times since the last update). Today I ordered the jumbo all beef, fries and onion rings, as always--and as always, it was delicious. Thanks Ted's!","date":"2008-04-30 07:47:27"}

The wait time for patio was only a few minutes. Although it was crowded, the noise level was very low. People were enjoying their beers and engaging in conversations that you could easily hear.The service was good as usual. I got the mushroom and chicken pizza, which is served on the same kind of bread as their Souvlaki. In fact, the chicken Souvlaki and my pizza tasted exactly the same when I added the Tzatziki sauce. The pizza was very so-so, and the toppings were so loose on the bread that I had to eat it like a sandwich. In comparison to the North York branch, the patio is the only bonus.\n\nWhat I like about Moxie's is that they cater to every taste.

We booked online which was fairly easy. It was really a bummer that they only allowed us 15 minutes before our jump time to set up our room. The party room upstairs was set up nicely but we did have lots of decorations to put up so that took some time away from me being able to experience what Gravady had to offer. In between setting up and checking people in throughout the party I was only able to jump with the kids for less than 5 minutes before it was time to get back to the party room. The attendant we had was very helpful in serving our guests and cleaning up spills\/messes. Everyone really enjoyed the experience and for many it was their first time going to Gravady. It is kind of pricey for just one hour especially when guests show up late and have only 30 minutes to jump. To offset the cost we made our own food so the fact that they let you bring in basically whatever you want really helped. The facility was very clean and bigger than I expected.. the only weird thing is that the jumpers either go barefoot or have to purchase gravady socks at $4 a pair. I'd much rather have the socks become a requirement and pay the price instead of thinking about all those dirty feet all over the place. The only suggestion I have for the staff is to think about how they can streamline the check in process or make is easier so that the host of the party doesnt have to run back and forth to check people in. And maybe space out party times by 30 mins instead of 15 so that we have enough time to set up and are able to enjoy the facility with our guests. Other than that, everyone had a blast and im sure they slept soundly that night also!","date":"2015-11-18 20:20:15"}

I showed up 10 minutes early. The stylist I was told would be styling that day, rudely informed me she was a level 5 stylist with a full client list and any stylist in the salon could do a good job.

I told myself, \"let's give the stylist a chance.\" I came in with my hair done as I always wear it, I explained exactly what I needed and wanted as well as showed the stylist pictures.

Well, the kind of party that involves food, that is.\nBefore we begin, let me educate you on the pronunciation of this place - read \"Verst\". And its exact English translation is non other than sausage (figures). This recently opened spot in the heart of King West has been successfully luring in lunch crowds. With its sausage hall concept, breadth of sausage styles and flavours and an impressive local and imported beer menu; Wvrst has quickly become a favourite in the area and the Friday lunch go-to place for most of us.\n\nTheir dedication to the core product, sausages; its one to admire. All sausages are freshly made on the premises and cooked when ordered. When you arrive at Wvrst, you right away notice a large line up of people (mostly men...I did say it was a sausage party) staring at the menu, asking the staff for advice and at times drinking beer while waiting in line. Because this is a sausage hall, once your food is ordered, you are given a number which then lets the waiters know which table to bring the food to. One thing you will notice is that because the line-ups are long, the waiters are extremely diligent in cleaning up the tables, so don't feel like they are rushing you, they are just doing their job and are very pleasant.\n\nNow, lets talk about the product. From the list, my favourite is the Venison style sausage. Given that its flavour is more on the smokey, nutty and hearty side, it makes it a great pairing with just about any topping. You can choose 2 out of 4 toppings - Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers and Sautéed Jalapeños. The roll used to wrap these juicy meats around is something worth mentioning, being on the rather soft side, this roll is lightly sweet with a hint of sourdough style bread, a great choice. Note to reader: you can also order a whole wheat roll and choice of veggie or chicken sausage options.\n\nAnother one of Wvrst's hits is their Duck Fat Fries. Fried in duck fat as opposed to regular oil, the fries tend to be softer and buttery, while maintaining a great consistency on the surface. How this is done? A two step frying process. Double-dipping is what I would name this frying method. The outcome? Buttery and flavourful french fries. \nBut the goodness does not end here, on top of having great tasting fries, Wvrst offers you a selection of dipping sauces. My favourite, and one that I can not live without, the Mojito sauce. Dip your fries in it or add it to your sausage party, either way you in are in for a heck of a tasty treat.\n\nUntil next time Foodies!\n\nBuen Provecho,\nViviana.","date":"2011-09-25 23:16:05"}

Whoa...\"Uh, yeah, how long is the wait?\" pause...HUGE eyeroll...\"Like, an hour. Hour and a half.

I looked down the street and pointed. \"DEAGAN'S!\" And sorry, I have a hard time believing that even Melt's super-hyped grilled cheese sandwiches could have lived up to our perfect lunch at Deagan's. Sometimes things really do happen for a reason, right?\n\nI really wanted the barbecue pork, but I also really wanted the pork belly brussels sprouts, and I knew I couldn't possibly devour both at lunchtime. Our waitress insisted that I absolutely NEEDED to try both, and took it upon herself to ask the kitchen to make me the barbecue pork appetizer from the dinner menu instead of the entree from the lunch menu. I've never actually liked brussels sprouts that much (it was the promise of pork belly that lured me in, of course) but these were seriously good. I guess I've just never had them cooked right--super tender and drenched in butter. Least healthy vegetable ever, but also maybe the most delicious. The barbecue pork on a jalepeño pancake was awesome too, but the brusselsprouts were lifechanging.\n\nOh, and the beer selection here is interesting and varied, just like the menu. Our waitress enthusiastically brought us samples of anything we even pointed at on the menu before we could attempt to refuse them. I kind of wish it wasn't 2 in the afternoon so I could have had more than one...haha.\n\nI will totally make a point of coming back here again.","date":"2011-08-25 04:24:23"}

Various coupons\/discounts are available for sauce which we used on both visits. Groupon $18 for $30 was used on the first visit and Yelp deal $50 voucher for $25, which was found on the Yelp app, was used on the second visit.\n\nOn our first lunchtime visit, we were sat in the bar area and I took the recommendations of our server Bernadette. For the appetizer, we had the pepperoni stuffed fried cheese. For entrees, my wife had the California panini and I had the Italian chimichanga. The common thread with our appetizer and my entree was the mix of pesto cream sauce and the tomato based marinara and arrabbiata sauces. I didn't think that was a good pairing. I might have the fried cheese again but without the pesto cream sauce. I wouldn't get the chimichanga again. There's too many ingredients (meatballs, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, mozzarella, and feta along with the arrabbiata and creamy pesto sauces) that just didn't meld well together.\n\nOn our second visit, we were seated on a Saturday night with one other table in the dining room. We ordered the kids fettuccine alfredo, the sauce sea bass (they were out of sea bass and salmon was substituted), and the create your pasta consisting of fettuccine, signature red sauce, meatball, roasted garlic, and mushrooms. If you're a garlic fan and not looking for any kind of make out session after dinner, order roasted garlic with your pasta. There were a total of about ten cloves of garlic in my pasta. For dessert, we had the zeppoli which was probably the best dish of the meal. Even with the lack of business, service was still slow. Everything was OK with this visit with nothing being bad, but nothing being that memorable.\n\nThe menu is large with a mix of traditional dishes and different creations so it's highly probable to find something of your liking. We just didn't score with either of our visits. I'd come back here if we had a discount or deal as we did with our previous visits and maybe we might find the dish that is right for us.","date":"2015-10-08 06:25:15"}

Just hearing about it from friends and reading reviews on Yelp made it that much more exciting. It's a very nice place, nice drive up entry and lobby, nice interior decor. It puts you in the mood for a nice relaxing dinner. Our server this night was Keith and he was very knowledgeable, prompt and patient. He explained everything from how the meal would be served, from the salad to the actual carving of the prime rib. You don't have to be concerned if you aren't sure what the various cuts of meat are. He said that when the chef comes table side he will show you the actual sizes. \n\nOkay. First off, you get your drink orders filled, then you start off with your salad when you are ready. The salad is prepared table side on a cart with a large bowl in a bed of ice. The server proceeds to spin the bowl and tosses the dressing into it. They have a house seasoned pepper to put on your salad which is made by Lawry's. Very good and refreshing.\n\nNext comes the main course... The prime rib! Yours truly opted for the Diamond Jim Brady cut, medium rare which has the bone in. It' s actually not that big of a serving when you consider that the bone is in. I think it was a 16oz cut. It was done perfect and I had it with the creamed spinach. Mashed potatoes come with it and the au jus is laddled onto your prime rib. Oh, and don't forget the Yorkshire pudding!  Also, my dining companion and I decided on a sizzling plate of mushrooms which were sautéed in butter and garlic. \n\nAs for dessert, well, that was far from my mind at the time! It was a very delicious and satisfying meal. If you decide on coming here for dinner, I suggest you have just a light lunch that day, I did and I'm glad I prepared myself for dinner!

The place is designed to look modern, but the place is overall dim, so you can't really notice anything negative or positive. Overall look is average.\n\nService here was impeccable. Even with a full house and people constantly coming in and out of the restaurant, I felt my table had 2-3 dedicated waiters at our beck and call. However, not everyone there speaks chinese though. Regardless, our plates were changed, soups were served into bowls, teas refilled, and fast paced service. The food just kept non-stop. Definitely top notch service for a chinese cuisine place, and a chain at that. \n\nMy table ordered the 8 person combo, at $238 with green onion rolled pancake with sliced pork, 2 extra orders of Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Ground Pork, and Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Dried Scallops, Pork & Luffa. The combo included, 5 variety cold dish, fish maw soup, peking duck with lettuce wrap upgrade, broccoli and eggs, leg of a pig, seafood veggie mix, steamed fish, mushroom greens, and lobster e-fu noodles.\n\nLet's start off with the extra sides. The steamed dumplings are definitely good. Not as good as Xiao Long Bao that opened up just down on huntingwood, but still better than most places. The green onion pancake with sliced pork is definitely top notch. I find most places skimp on the green onion, the sauce, or\/either the amount of pork. This place got it just right!! I was honestly expecting subpar food since this place was a chain, but a lot of the items were above expectations. The ones that shone the most were definitely the 5 variety cold dish taking first, broccoli and eggs taking second, and peking duck takes the third.\n\nThe cold dish honestly surprised me, it is usually too cold, making it lack flavour or too hard\/chewy to have good texture. This one was bursting with flavour, moist and appetizing. The eggs within the broccoli is usually tame, but this one made my eyes go O_O, \"what is this?\" I typically don't care for this dish, but this was unique. It was strong, but not too salty and it didn't require any vinegar at all. Peking duck taste third, since there was ample meat in each slice, and the mix with the lettuce was crispy and refreshing!\n\nAll pictures attached, and definitely recommend people come try, as this chain restaurant is better than some traditionally opened chinese restaurants!","date":"2015-10-17 04:59:49"}

After this experience we looked on the floors and bed and saw at least 4 bugs running across the room and sheets. If that wasn't exciting we noticed cockroaches, beetles, and god knows what else crawling down through the walls and bathroom. Without exaggerating we killed at least 30 bugs and spanning from all sorts. They offered to move us to a different room but at that point we wanted nothing to do with the room.  The one positive of this whole experience was the lady who helped us out at the front desk. Extremely nice and apologetic. I wish I remembered her name.

First was a half chorizo that was cooked with red wine and flame grilled tableside.\n\nNext, we had the dish Halloumi, goat cheese grilled over cypress and served with a sweet and sour sauce. \n\nNext came the snails cooked with a chardonnay white wine and garlic sauce and broiled with mixed cheeses and served with some toast slices.\n\nNext was Bacalao, a dish made up of salted cod, mashed potatoes, garlic, onions, eggs and extra virgin olive oil and served with a salad of mixed greens.  Lubka (Luby) told us how they treated the salt cod daily with whole milk to remove the saltiness of the cod so it wasn't overpoweringly salty.\n\nThen onto the chicken Trinchado.  The chicken is marinated in red wine and grilled.  It's then put in the Trinchado sauce which had a nice paprika flavor and a small hint of cumin.\n\nThen we had the Calamari curry, a bowl of nicely cooked calamari in a curry sauce that didn't hit you up front but had a nice curry tang after the fact.  It was quite good.  With the calamari, we got rice and a container of chutney.  The flavors complimented each other nicely.\n\nWhen we thought we had no more room, Luby insisted we have some dessert.  We went with the tiramisu.  It's quite a different looking dish from common tiramisu.  The  ladyfingers weren't like most tiramisu but there was a wonderful chocolate and \ncoffee flavor in the ladyfingers and the mascarpone cheese made this a wonderful ending dish.\n\nService was outstanding for the two hours or so that we were there.  We asked that the dishes not be brought out all at once and they did one at a time.  Luby came to the table and asked if it was OK to start the next dish.  She explained the dishes when she brought them and she was an absolute joy!  She's very proud of her food and she has reason to be proud!  \n\nThis was a very memorable lunch with good company, good conversation, excellent food, and outstanding and very pleasant service.

The system originated with one man, Imi who developed it in the ghettos of Europe pre WWII and later fine tuned it in Israel. It is used by military, law enforcement and similar organizations worldwide. \n\nThe \"Tribe\" is truly like family led by the ever vigilant and innovative Donavin Britt. Real life scenarios (ie disarming a knife\/gun wielding attacker, plucking away a choke hold, getting OFF of the ground, getting to safety after thwarting an attack, etc) The instructors are all top notch and are truly interested in each student being the best he or she can be. \n\nClasses usually start with drills ranging from sprinting\/suicides outdoors, to calisthenics to the point of exhaustion, Crossfit and even sledge hammers taken to giant tires out back. You work HARD here. \n\nKrav Maga isn't about mastering a fancy kick: it is about identifying a threat, neutralizing it and getting to safety. Though you are taught to break free from being pinned on ground, etc the focus is on being on your feet. This is not grappling.  \n\nPeople of all ages from children to older adults benefit from this system. After training for a while, you can test for Fight Class which involves an all day series of everything you've learned up to that point amped up. Again, instructors and students alike support one another throughout the process as they do in class and beyond. \n\nDue to a bad concussion, I'm unable to participate in most of the Krav activities and I really miss it. Being empowered as a woman (or man) and having confidence that you can defend yourself and push past self imposed limits is an invaluable gift Donavin, DC and all of the instructors provide. Plus, it is a great stress reliever to kick & punch tombstone pads and all of the off the hook drills they dream up. \n\nI'd recommend this school to anyone who wants to learn the practical techniques and add new challenges to their fitness regime. Truly miss the Tribe and hope to be among them again, soon.","date":"2012-06-25 23:54:52"}

Her curriculum and activities keep the students engaged. Whenever I drop off or pick up pepper, the kids are engaged in some activity or another. Pepper has learned how to write some of her letters already, is learning and excited by mandarin, and has come home bragging how she has tried some new food margot introduced and liked it. She enjoys puppet shows there, new songs, new dances, even Kung fu! Before when I dropped her off, she would be upset, now she looks forward to school. Also, if you care about diversity like I do, the kids here are from all backgrounds. That is a win!","date":"2017-06-28 02:01:36"}

The prices are insanely low. The owner(s?) are cool and friendly. AND! I heard they're trying to get a liquor license, which would make Maui Dog even cooler than it already is! You get a card for a free dog when you buy 12. Whenever I go, it's so deserted. I hope more people will eat here so they'll stick around!\n\nTheir buns are so damn good, I could probably eat my weight in them. The dogs are huge. I've had a plain lava dog, which was good. Even better the second time when I made it shaggy (and I usually hate cole-slaw). The tiki dog is good too, but I think my favorite is the shaggy lava. My boyfriend usually gets the island dog (and I usually eat some of it) which is great! The chipotle garlic mayo and maui mustard cannot be easily replicated!\n\nThe tots are always cooked perfectly. I had a Horchata shave ice which didn't really taste Horchata-y, but it was yummy. The best thing to drink is their red cream soda though.. reminds me of being a kid. \n\nNext time we go, I'm going to buck up and try the spam sliders.

Couple that with their own hype machine of  \"our medium is VERY HOT\", the running competition of who can eat the most, etc, and really, I expect something better than a standard mass-market-pub chicken wing.\n\nWhat I got is a standard mass-market-pub chicken wing.  Juicy meat, sure, but way too much sauce* left the wings soggy.  I want some crispness to my wings.  Were they tasty?  Sure.  Are they worth over a buck a wing?  I'm not so sure.  Factor in their overpriced crap-domestic beer and mediocre fries and I'm left with little reason to go out of my way to visit the place.  Anyway, on to specifics:\n\nI call a huuuuuge BS on their heat claims.  If I had known how run of the mill their \"Hot\" was, I would have instead ordered \"Superhot\" or \"Death\".  As a consumer, I find that misleading and disappointing.   \n\nI've been a hot aficionado since I was ten years old.  I feel more pain biting into a jalapeno (3500-8000 Scoville) than I did eating ten of their \"hot\"... a jalapeno is practically a fruit!  I didn't even have to blow my nose or clear my throat, nor did I touch my beer until after the meal.\n\nListen, I get it, marketing is king... but c'mon.  At least try to back it up!  \n\nI'm a bit sad to do it, but Duff's clocks in at an underachieving 2 stars.  Not only have I experienced better, I've also experienced hotter.\n\n*  I am surely wrong, but I'd swear their \"hot\" sauce is Frank's Extra Hot mixed with butter.

The fact that I'm from out of town clearly means I won't be a regular here, so he didn't have to go out of his way. It was unfortunate my food was late but unlike the servers who answered the phone & casually just said my order wasn't placed, then handed the phone to the manager because they didn't want to deal with me, the manager going out of his way to make sure I was happy really stood out to me.

It was my first time trying lardo in this way, and it's texture was like caramel but tasted like cream. Very interesting! Next was the Trota, steelhead trout with a yogurt and herbs on top. The raw trout was fatty and meatier-tasting than tuna sashimi (as a benchmark) but the preparation kept it light and balanced. The most adventurous dish of the night was the Cervello. It's basically lamb's brain wrapped in a crispy salty bacon wrap. It sounds crazy but the brain is very light and has the texture of cream-cheese. It was a fun dish.\n\nOf course, if you want to be less adventurous there are plenty of pastas, pizzas and entrees to choose from.

I explained that we have no such person.  So her bright idea was \"oh just call vitacost.com maybe they will issue you a refund or replacement.\" I said \"I tried them already, since you said it was delivered, I am S.O.L!\" and she then decided that she will ask the driver what happened and call me back. *Right like the driver is going to say \"Yeah I lost her package, my bad.\" \n\n2 days later I get a call back, she says \"The driver says he placed it at the leasing office and it is there now.\"  I put her on hold and with my 2nd line I called my leasing office and nope sure enough, not there.  SO I asked her to have the driver call me when he is there so I can prove it to you all that you're at the wrong property.  The lady told me that she can't do that.

He didn't, because your driver is a LIAR, since I know for a fact that my leasing office wouldn't have given him my apartment number!\" She said she would call him and then call me back. \n\n2 days later: I get another call, now from a completely different person, trying to sell me that last bit of garbage from the previous call, about the door tag nonsense.  She then decided that she would call me back. \n\nAfter 3 more days of no contact, I decided I would email them a letter of \"WTF happened to my package!\" I am still waiting for a response. \n\nHowever I did get a refund finally from Paypal.com of all places! I opened a claim and stated my case and they sided with me.","date":"2014-10-27 06:16:49"}

I had a great experience with a nice girl. I then called to schedule another appointment with her and did not remember her name, so I referred to her as the white girl and then there were two other African American girls who work there.\n\nThe girl that I usually saw was not there this day, so I asked if they had any other people working who weren't the African American girls because I thought they only did hair cuts and African American girls hair.

I despise everything about Kinko's. I don't even know where to begin. Buckle in, this is bound to be long winded.\n\nOnce upon a time, I thought Kinko's was this magical place full of neat machines and free paperclips that was constantly full of cool projects and was hopping twenty four hours a day. Then I began to need to use them for my job, and that's just when all the trouble began. First of all, very few Kinko's, if any, are even open twenty four hours a day anymore! But that was just the initial crack in their facade for me. See, I used to be able to just email them a document as an attachment, and put instructions in the body of the email. Then I would follow up with a call to make sure they got the file, which they always did. They would tell me over the phone when I could pick it up, and the orders were always on time. \n\nTHEN everything changed. They no longer accept email orders. They have created the most complicated and horribly bass-ackwards program on their website to upload documents. I understand why they did it, and I'm not saying it's a bad idea. I'm just saying the program needs some major overhauling because it never ever ever EVER works right. Either I can't explain what I need to them through their structured questions, or it won't upload right, or the submit button doesn't work. Then, once I finally get it to work, I have to call them 20-30 minutes later. Generally, they still haven't received my file by my first call. So I call back. I'm left on hold forever, and when they return, they still have to ask a billion questions about my order because their system doesn't tell them what they need to know. It takes virtually forever.\n\nI really feel for the employees at Kinko's. I once worked for a copy shop, and I know how hectic things can get. That being said, I have never witnessed more incompetent help in my life. I don't blame any of the individuals that work there, Kinko's probably just has provided very little useful training for them. But still, I dread going in there. Even to simply pick up a completed order, it will take no less than 30 minutes.\n\nOn top all of that, Kinko's is expensive. Needlessly so. Simply because they have a stranglehold over the copying business gives them no right to charge those ridiculous rates for various services.

The concept is good, but the execution seems flawed. I don't really know what i was expecting - I guess that the sausage would taste a lot different from a cheap BBQ'd Toronto street food hot dog - it really didn't. They might be home made and (possibly) one would assume nitrate free, but they didn't taste that much different. Even the hot dog buns are the same as the ones you get on the street (i.e. the exactly the same - yes, that cheap-ass bread that goes soggy the moment any moisture hits it). Surely a gourmet hot dog deserves at least a home made gourmet bun to go with it? We had two hot dogs. They both came with a rather nasty creamy coleslaw that doesn't really work too well in a hot dog. A portion of fries was greasy and soggy. Tastier sauerkraut can be found in the supermarket.\n\nService was fine and friendly - the place wasn't busy. However, they will need to move faster when there is a rush on.  The drinks on offer are actually more appealing than the food - very decent and surprisingly varied beer selection and home made sodas.\n\nSo onto value - with tax these hot dogs are pushing $10 a piece (some are over that). Are they 3x better than some of the hot dog vendors on the street? No. More importantly - would we recommend this place or be going back? - unfortunately not. \n\nOverall just really disappointing. I know it is the first day, but there are some fundamental misses here on the taste side of the house - the service was fine. We had high hopes for this concept, but I think we will stick with the gourmet burgers for now.","date":"2013-05-29 01:14:47"}

After looking up several area furniture stores online, I found a great-looking bed at Rooms to Go Furniture's website, so my wife and I decided to visit the store.\n\nRooms to Go has a very attractive showroom and is designed to appeal to the visual senses. Rooms to Go specializes in modern style furniture, unlike many of the other, more conservative, furniture stores in the immediate area. If you are looking for a more hip, modern look, Rooms to Go is where you want to start looking.\n\nWe were helped immediately by our salesman upon entering the store. He was able to locate the bed I was interested in and assisted me in finding the appropriate mattress for it as well. I ended up purchasing a matching chest of drawers and end table. \n\nWe were assured that all the items were in stock and would be delivered on 2\/29 to our home. The delivery people arrived on time today and had the entire bedroom assembled within 40 minutes. They were extremely professional and efficient.\n\nI plan to make Rooms to Go my place to go for any other furniture we may need. We will be in the market for a sofa or chairs coming up and this is definitely where we will begin our search.","date":"2012-03-01 03:38:53"}

We arrived around 12:30, and the place was not super packed but obviously busy. The decor was sparse but nice and fairly modern. We were greeted twice promptly, and told we'd be seated momentarily, which we were. Free chips and salsa were delivered -- my companion noted that the chips seemed like Doritos without any of the cheese or Cool Ranch flavoring on them, as they were perfect triangles and there was nothing special about them. The two \"salsas\" that came with the chips were flavorful but super watery, with no chunks of veggies or even any thickness to them -- when you dipped your chip, liquid just ran off and nothing stuck. Blah. Our server (not sure of his name -- on the receipt, it only said \"Server\") had the personality of a wall: not friendly, barely smiled, and had no recommendations whatsoever. We each ordered a margarita, and were asked if we wanted a small ($6.50) or large ($9.00). When we asked about the size difference, he couldn't explain it with either words (ounces) OR his hands (???) so we decided to just try the small size. VERY disappointing -- the glass was FULL of ice cubes, and I literally think I took about five medium-sized sips before it was gone. Also, it tasted mostly like water, with very little lime flavor and clearly less alcohol. For $6.50 it was a MAJOR ripoff. On to the food. Between the two of us, we ordered the tableside guacamole, one plate of three tacos, and one plate of a tostada and a taco. The tableside guacamole was made by a VERY sweet and friendly woman (maybe one of the owners?) who chatted with us through the making of it -- her bright personality was pretty much the only redeeming part of the whole meal. The guac was yummy, and we loved that it was customizable (you got to choose which of about six extra ingredients were mixed in), but it was made with only a single avocado and a few mix-ins and not worth the $8.49 price tag -- we were not even offered any extra chips beyond those already served with our \"salsas.\" When the tacos and tostada were delivered, I was shocked: my friend's tostada was a normal size and looked tasty, but the tacos were TINY, maybe 4\" across (at least 2-3\" less than a \"normal\" corn tortilla). The filling was decent (I ordered one steak, one campechanos, and one pastor), but nothing to write home about. Our server checked in with us a few times during the meal, but made it seem like it was an inconvenience for him, plus never took any of our empties off the table or asked me if I wanted a second margarita (perhaps he couldn't see that it was empty due to ALL THE ICE STILL IN THE GLASS). He gave us our check before we were even done eating, and rushed us out at the end of our meal (even though the place was nearly empty by then) which was quite disappointing. I can't recommend this place, and I won't be back.","date":"2018-03-23 17:04:25"}

The decor and service were great especially for an after work rush.  Although, it is truly a verbatim Happy Hour that ends at 6pm.  Not the biggest fan of a short happy hour, but I understand that Downtown doesn't draw the same volume of people after work as Tempe or Scottsdale.\n\nWe decided to sit at the hightop bar so we could get a great view of the place.  It's a very open concept with a nice view into the hustling kitchen and outward view of the US Airways Center.  Great urban vibe.\n\nThe food is where it fell a little short. The Salmon sounded great with farro, fennel, and roasted apples, but didn't live up to it's $22 price tag.  Portion size was decent, but nothing outstanding about the flavor.  Maybe my time in NYC has spoiled my taste buds.\n\nOur bartender was also a bourbon drinker and recommended the Candlestick Maker.  She made a great drink.  I tried the Turkey Sloppy Joe feeling that the poblano peppers would pair well with the bourbon, but should have trusted my gut and figured that the sloppy joe was probably part of the kids menu.  Could really use some more zest and kick.\n\nOverall, it's a nice addition to CityScape and will definitely try to make happy hour again.\n\nOh, the Artichoke Hummus was the best part of the night.

And on my way out I was thanked for coming in by the manager and two other staff.\n\nFast food is nice but if by getting really fast the quality goes away you haven't gained anything.  I may give them another chance but not much further away is another location that has always gotten it right.","date":"2010-03-13 15:55:14"}

What went from 6 people turned into 11 amazing group of friends going to dinner together. Midi is relatively small and cozy bistro but the staff handled our large group very well. The Winterlicious menu was only $25.00 and I would say you definitely get your dollars worth. \n\nAs a starter I had the Salad Midi which was nice and light way start to my meal. It was made with mixed greens, prosciutto, asiago cheese, dried berries & pesto drizzle.  But of course, I had to steal from others plates as well. The Crostini was superb as well! For the main, I decided to go with the Fettuccini with Black Tiger Shrimp, Atlantic Salmon, Mussels, Roasted Red Peppers, Baby Spinach in a Rose Sauce. I was slightly disappointed with the main. I wish they had made the salmon and red peppers into bigger pieces instead of blending it into the sauce. The Black Tiger Shrimp was amazing and fresh though. For dessert I had the Profiteroles which is Choux Pastry with Vanilla ice Cream & Hot Chocolate Sauce. It was my first time trying Profiteroles and I have to say I didn't enjoy them as much as I would have liked to. The Choux Pastry tasted somewhat like soggy pancakes because the ice cream was melting and the Hot Chocolate Sauce tasted like store bought chocolate sauce. There was nothing special about it.  \n\nOverall, I had a fantastic time at Midi. The service was fantastic. The washroom was kept clean. The portions were great. Definitely will go back but this time with a smaller group or just a romantic date! ;)","date":"2014-02-05 20:43:08"}

Damn Holler & Dash, I tell you what, there's some magic going on behind that counter. I guess I should elaborate!\n\nAround here is where I'd typically insert the obvious hollaback one liner. I'll yield to the other reviews, you beat me to it! When you walk in, the warm, natural interior design makes you feel very welcome. Good use of several elements such as stone, timber, and an exposed ceiling give the whole dining area a spacious atmosphere. When I visited Saturday morning it was very clean and ready for a big rush.\n\nSpeaking of rush, if you want a calm visit then make sure you stop by as early as possible (they open at 7am every morning). The place fills up very fast. Fortunately they have a TON of staff on hand to handle to the heavy hours.\n\nMy first visit I tried one of the signature biscuits: Chicken Set Go! There was a bit of a sticker shock on the price at $9, however once you get it, you'll see that this is no ordinary biscuit. First of all, it's HUGE. I mean the top half of the biscuit is larger than the whole of what you'd get at most places. This particular creation had moist, seasoned fried chicken topped with pimento cheese, pickled jalapeno, sorghum, and served with a side.\n\nIt's a winner! Wow, that chicken tho. The chicken was moist, and had the right concoction of spices. Perfectly breaded and fried right on the money. Just the right amount of crunch for a best-case biscuit. Pimento cheese provided a delicious creaminess and the pickled jalapenos the right amount of sour astringency to redline all of my tastebuds. Who knew a biscuit could be this complex, yet all come together to make the breakfast of your dreams? What I thought was overpriced at first all the sudden had a ton of value in size, taste, and presentation.\n\nThe cheese grits were very good. A lot of \"Southern Breakfast\" places around here give you a bowl of grits that look almost watered down, for me the thicker the better and here they do it right. Very well seasoned too, which is not always a gimme when it comes to grits. The kitchen staff has really proven themselves with my breakfast.\n\nThe only problem for the rest of my day was that I was ready to take a nap about 20 minutes after eating this!

I would not say it's our favourite restaurant for lunch, but it's definitely our default when we want an Asian fusion joint with a quiet atmosphere. There is a lot of natural light that streams into the small space during their operational hours, so that most likely contributes to this too, mood-wise. \n\nIts concept is nice: western cafe meals (eg. Pastas, casseroles, fries, etc.) with a Japanese twist. \n\nEven though I have a penchant for Japanese fusion cuisine, this cafe falls flat. When I first went here the servers were attentive and the food had a more memorable flavour. Now, the servers never swing by at all. Some may like this, but when one expects bottomless coffee to be refilled, this doesn't sit well. After receiving your food, don't expect servers to even look at you again (the two servers were too busy talking to each other near the cash register). I heard that there is a revolving door of workers here, so this may be why the staff seem less professional than I remember.  As such, be warned about the bill: I asked for split bills, but one waitress said that wouldn't be possible unless we paid in cash, whereas on my second attempt another waitress had split the bills for us without question. The food was nothing special either. I got the crab rice casserole, which hardly had any crab meat at all and which  tasted like a casserole from any corner HK style cafe.","date":"2017-06-28 00:37:25"}

They also have a swing area, several pros on staff, and club repair.  Their apparel selection is average, but tasteful.\n\nOne of the advantages of Golfsmith is that they stock Titleist products, which the PGA Superstore does not (they are in a contract dispute with Acushnet). \n\nThe staff at Golfsmith, for the most part, are very friendly, and helpful.

While the patio and dinning room were packed, the bar seats in front of the wood\/stone oven were open! Who wouldn't want to watch them artfully craft delicious food? I could have sat there alone and been completely entertained. Instead, the staff dazzled my family and I as we relaxed and perused the menu. \n\nAs far as service goes, I left over a 20% tip if that gives you any indication of how our meal went. I prefer bar service. I don't like the over-attention of being seated in dinning rooms and served. At the bar I always feel like I'm getting a more genuine experience without being suffocated. The gent at Humble Wine Bar did a great job of exactly that--great, quick service without being bothered. He took our orders, offered some feedback and even had a witty comeback for dad, who often loves teasing our servers at restaurants. My mom spilled her beer on her entire pizza and despite insisting she didn't want another pie, he put in an order and didn't charge us. Like I said, great service.\n\nMy dad loves wine and pizza, which is a big reason why we came here--but mostly the wine. He enjoyed the two glasses of red he had and compared them to the varieties he had tried on his recent trip to France. I also enjoyed the rose cava and the red I tried. But really, any restaurant or bar that offers great sparkling wine or cava by the glass is awesome in my book. \n\nWe ordered the margherita and soppressata pizzas to share. My mom tried the house salad and my dad and I split the caprese with prosciutto. Both the salad and caprese dish were delicious. Where some felt the house salad fell short without adequate dressing, we found it perfectly dressed. All the flavors of the spicy greens paired with the currants were present without the dressing taking over the entire dish. And there was no trace of the overuse of oil. I often make vinaigrettes at home and find a lot of restaurants do them wrong. They are actually more oil than anything else, but must be properly emulsified to taste balanced. The caprese was awesome with thick slices of house-made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes and a light drizzle of balsamic reduction. The dish also came with two hunks of freshly baked bread and a mound of some of the best prosciutto I've had in a long time.  The pizzas were perfectly cooked right in front of us in their 800+ degree wood stone oven. The crusts were perfectly bubbled and chewy without being too thick or thin. The sauce was well-balanced and you could taste their house-made mozzarella melted on top. \n\nSomething tells me I'm going to have a hard time convincing my family to try any other restaurants next time we have plans to eat out in Lakewood.","date":"2015-05-26 11:57:15"}

Priceless.\n\nThis park offers some rare downtown hill climbing, which is great if you want to add a little switch to your workout routine (or if you just like rolling down hills).  In the midst of fall foliage season or the first blooms of spring, heading down to Trinity Bellwoods for a little nature loving is practically a requisite pilgrimage.  And while it's a little less impressive than the more Westerly High Park, you are certainly going to feel a little sigh of green relief after an afternoon's frolick (preferably after brunch to work off the Hollandaise-related fog).  \n\nThis city can be so gray at times, especially if your neighborhood has more concrete than grass.  Stepping into the park for a few hours' stroll is a huge way to decompress.

The front desk handles the check in and house keeping. \n\nWe came in for some r and r as well as a concert. The rooms have full kitchens with plates,  pots and silverware etc. Stove, refrigerator and dishwasher. \n\nThe bathrooms are awesome, nicely tiled. Very  large bath tubs. Separate large shower with an overhead fixture as well as the regular sprayer.\n\nBed was super comfy and was set up with four pillows. Nice balcony  (27th floor) and view.\nNo casino in this tower, but there is a second floor connector tunnel that will take you to the casino. There's also one restaurant.\n\nWe paid $330 total for two nights, not bad.","date":"2017-03-27 03:12:35"}

A few friends and I came after hitting some bars at midnight to grab a bite to eat and have some beers. The waitress (a stubby Caucasian lady) came over and we asked about their beers - she promptly turned a drink menu to us. Then we asked about the shooters they had and she rudely said \"uh like all of them\". Okay. I think part of your job should be to know at least a few of those shooters and beers to recommend to customers. It was apparent she didn't want to be there. \n\nLater on, the bill came to $46 so my friends put down two twentys and a ten. The waitress came over and said \"you need change?\" and we did not. I did not want my friends to pay for me but I only had a $50 bill with me. She saw that I wanted to pay for my own meal so she came over to me and quickly said \"Your meal was $10, if I give you two twentys (from the pile) and take your fifty, then you have paid for your meal\". Me, being a bit buzzed and tired said \"Sure\" and then she quickly took my fifty AND the ten dollar bill. Right away my friend realized \"You know we tipped her $14 for shitty service right?\" I was appalled - it felt like she manipulated me in order to get $10 more tip. I would be ok with tipping 30% IF the server was friendly and actually made it seem like she wanted to be there but she didn't. The waitress didn't come back with the change. I hate being played so I asked the other waitress there if we could have the change back and I would leave the tip on the table. We then watched as the other waitress talked to our waitress in the corner clearly throwing shade and talking shit about us. And boy, did she take her time getting the change. My friends were \"too prideful\" to stay and wait for the change but I'm quite sure she had no intention of bringing it to us. \n\nI use to work as a waitress and I NEVER would assume that I could keep the change nor would I ever manipulate customers to tip me more. The next day I called and explained the situation to a worker there and she took my name and number and said she would call back later - she never did. Obviously, a $10 loss isn't a big deal at all (even though I am a poor student). However, I don't like how she manipulated the situation and took advantage of customers.

Returning week after week (I work during the week, would go here on Saturdays) didn't solve it, they'd re-balance, tell me they were going to torque the rims with the vehicle up in the air, tell me they would do a road force balancing, etc. then blame the truck!\n\nI have lifetime alignments on the truck, every 5k there is an oil change, alignment adjustment and rotate and balancing. Front end has been checked by Nissan, Firestone and yours truly.  I don't think things have changed that much in the industry from 15 years ago where I would call the manufacturer of the tire and work out a pro-ration and exchange for a different type of tire (customer pays for tread used) when a tire just doesn't work on a vehicle or someone isn't satisfied with the tires. I was at the point where I was ready to purchase 2 new to replace the worn and talk to Yokohama about pro-rating the other 2. Almost 3 years of \"trying\", we're done. \n\nStraw the broke the camel's back though was their selective measurement of the tire tread. 4 months ago, I was measured at 5\/32nds (new is 10-12 and legally bald is 2-3). 2 months later I bring her to Discount to see how much I'll get for the mileage warranty and was told the tires are at 6\/32nds.... no way they can do a mileage warranty. They wouldn't measure the center that was showing wear bars. I leave... 2 weeks later, have the truck at Firestone for her alignment and oil change, they measure the rear tires at 4\/32nds and find a nail in a sidewall of one of them. OK, 4\/32nds at FS, 6\/32nds at DT, let's go use my replacement certificate. Of course, when measuring for a road hazard replacement, they only measure the center which is at 2\/32nds.  NOW he wants to talk mileage warranty?!??!?!  Now I know why that lady threw her tire of the store in their commercials =). Ever not satisfied, just bring it back...?

I have a puppy that has a lot of energy and this park is pretty big, giving her lots of room to run around and, of course, get tired. I don't like to go too late in the day because there are just too many dogs and she gets distracted, but my late morning trips have always been a pleasure. \n\nMy one dislike about the park is that part of it appears to be a retention basin. Water collects and stagnates in a particular area and they use PVC and plastic fencing to block it off. It doesn't do anything to keep the dogs out. They need to re-engineer where the water runs off or determine a better way to secure that disgusting pool of water.\n\nThe park does not have a section for timid or small dogs and one for large dogs. I've seen people bring toy sized dogs, 2-3lbs, and I was a little concerned the dogs would get trampled\/ attacked. I caught my little 20lb Basenji mix stalking one of these tiny dogs, so I had to shift her attention. If you want to bring a tiny dog to this park simply for socialization, I'd recommend being the dog during a time there would only be a hand full of dog owners around, so you can better monitor your dog. Otherwise keep your really tiny dogs are home.","date":"2017-05-26 01:21:59"}

The chicken enchiladas were good due mostly in part to the addition of over easy eggs, but the banh mi was fairly disappointing. It's certainly unrealistic to expect amazing things from a Vietnamese sandwich made by a brewery in Scottsdale, but the item was very poorly flavored and constructed. Additionally, the service was abysmal. I often don't even notice poor service or whether certain items take a long time to be prepared, but Four Peaks really disappointed me in that regard.","date":"2016-11-10 05:14:25"}

All other comparable hotels were easily over $500 for two nights so I ended up going with South Point for roughly $300 for two nights.  \n\nAt first I was a little worried about staying here mainly due to the commute (not the quality of the place as it was opened in 2005) but I was happily surprised.  \n\nCheck in was a breeze even though it was the Friday before NYE and everyone was coming into town.  Even though there was quite a long line the casino had all the counters manned and checking in and getting into the room took less than 20 minutes.  Moreover, during check in they also give you a coupon book for some free stuff or buy one get one free stuff which was kind of cool.  Only complaint was that when calling in to inquire about when you can check in took about 10 minutes on hold to get to speak with someone.\n\nThe room itself was very spacious and clean and comes with all the amenities that you would expect from a reputable Vegas hotel.  Our room consisted of a king size bed, flatscreen TV, table, and a sofa (along with the rest of the nightstand, drawers, and closet).  This room could easily stuff 6 or so people in it if you really wanted to.  Moreover, it was nice how their bathroom was divided into two, with a door between the shower\/toilet and the sink, thus allowing two people to share the bathroom at a time.  Definitely no complaints about the spaciousness or cleaniness of the room here.\n\nMoreover, while I did not get to try out their amenities during my stay this time, I think I will definitely be back next time to try out their midnight madness bowling.  Apparently, during the weekdays after midnight all games are only a dollar!  I mean can you imagine, forget beer pong, how about beer bowling or a shot for every pin left standing haha.  \n\nAs for the food of this place, again I did not get to try out much but their Steak N Shake seemed like a decent and moderately priced place to get a meal.  I actually ended up getting a togo order of 3 sliders and shake for about $11 bucks so that wasn't too bad.\n\nAs for the convenience of this location, well for off-strip, it is pretty convenient even during NYE.  Located right off the freeway, it is easy to get to and out of into the Strip.  It is about a 15 minute drive by freeway and about a 20 minute drive by Las Vegas Blvd (I like how you have two routes to this place) with either being traffic free by the times I was driving.  \n\nAs a note, if you are planning to come here for New Years park at the Mandalay Bay!  The Strip is closed until 3am but as Mandalay Bay is at the end of the Strip you can still get out and take either Las Vegas Blvd or the freeway back without much hassle.\n\nOnly complaint with this place is that their shuttle to and from the Strip (cheap at only $8 all you can ride for a day) only runs till 1:00am.  Who goes back to the hotel at 1:00am in Vegas...especially on New Years.  They should make it 24 hours or at least 24 hours on the holidays.","date":"2012-01-03 18:43:58"}

All you have to do is combine goat cheese and guacamole for me to love you. Does that make me easy? Probably. \n\nBut really, this place lives up to its hype. I've been here twice, and both times have just been extraordinary. Their taquito entrees are delicious, and their sides are to die for. For the taquitos, I had the remolacha. A bunch of different flavors and textures that will amaze you. Regarding the sides, the smoked gouda tamales and the sofrito green beans will leave you wondering what you've been eating your entire life. It's like an explosion of flavor enticing your taste buds. Yes, my mouth is currently watering.\n\nBe warned-if you get the guacamole trio, like we did, be prepared to take the rest of your meal home. It's more than we bargained for, but oh so delicious. The goat cheese guac, pineapple guac, and blue cheese guac are all excellent. I've also tried the jalapeno bread pudding for dessert. Simply amazing. You get the flavor of jalapeno without all that heat, and it just makes for a very unique dish. \n\nIf anything is the downfall, its the wait in general. Waits to get a table are long, but nothing going next door to Johnny Mango's for their super strong mojitos won't fix. We had a wait a bit for our server the second time, which was a bit of an annoyance. However, this place is worth it, trust me.","date":"2012-06-26 04:59:58"}

I took my van in on 2 March 16 and I had 29,700 miles.  My battery was dying so I made an appointment at 5 to have it checked out.  After a little over an hour Keith called me and stated that, yes my battery failed and that it was replaced under warranty.  I am like cool but then he showed me the multi point inspection sheet that my front brakes were at 3 and 2 mm and my rear brakes were at 7mm.  He said it would cost 329.00 to replace the front brakes but I had my kids so I told him I couldn't at that time but will comeback in a few days.  So I left and went home and told the wife the outcome.  She then stated \" weren't the brakes at 8 or 7 the last time it was there?  I was like yea your right, so I went and took out the invoice and looked on the inspection sheet and yes it stated my front brakes were at 7mm(Green) and rear at 5mm(Yellow).  That was on 18 Jan 16 and my mileage was at 28,500. So within a month and half, 1,200 miles later my front brakes went from 7mm to 2mm and rear brakes went from 5mm back to 7mm.  WOW...I bought this van in Las Vegas in May of 2014.  We moved in June of 2015 to Pennsylvania and drove the van.  So from May 2014 to Jan 2016 and 5 to 28,500 miles my front brakes went from 10mm to 7mm and rear brakes went from 10mm to 5mm which sounds about right.  So doing the math, that's the front brakes losing 3mm and rear brakes losing 5mm.  Now from 18 Jan 16 to 2 Mar 16 and 28,500 to 29,700 miles my front brakes went from 7mm to 2mm and my rear brakes went from 5mm to 7mm, so again doing the math my front brakes lost 5mm and rear brakes gained 2mm.  So just under 2 years I lost 3mm, then under 1.5 months I lost 5mm...I don't think so.  They obviously tried to scam me into getting front brakes when I don't really need them and I would have got them if it wasn't for my kids being with me at the time.

My coworker and I enjoyed going to Hot n Juicy but she told me that this place was the new contender so I had to see for myself. \n\nI'd have to disagree.... but it's not bad like some of the other places in Vegas.\n\nPros: \n-Menu options are great, especially on the back where you can get large combo platters if you and a friend want to share a variety. \n-Menu is pretty clear and easy to understand. \n-Lobster claw game at $2 a play is entertaining at best but difficult to grab, lobsters are usually clumped together in the corner\n-Sauce is not oily like the competition which kept my stomach ache free\n\nCons:\n-There was a manager lady who wasn't friendly at all. I was seated by a gentlemen but the lady came by to drop off the menus without a single kind gesture, and didn't even ask if I wanted anything to drink while I wait for my friends.\n-The sauce is less oil but lacks heavily in flavor. The hot n juicy special is loaded with spices and garlic to give you a delicious kick. The sauce here was spicy but bland\n-All the seafood is market price and listed on a tiny neon menu in the center of the restaurant. Maybe putting more around the restaurant so people don't have to get up to see it\n-Shrimp is puny.....  (no pun intended)\n\nOverall: I'd come back with friends but this wouldn't be my go to.

Quickly we figure out that I've made my appointment with Pearson and not them.   Prepared to just forgo my appointment with Pearson and make a new appointment with Visionworks, I inform them the reason for my visit (Glaucoma check) and ask them if they have my old records to compare my next visit with.   Thier answer:  \"We have you on file but your records are in storage\".   I'm not sure what that means.  Are they still using manilla folders and file cabinets?  Do they have a unit at Uncle Bob's Storage?  Quickly I realize I want to keep my appointment with Pearson.  So I appolgize for the interuption and ask them where Pearson EyeCare is.  The \"wrong\" Optometrist ended up being the \"right\" one.    I don't have insurance and the price for a full exam was extremely reasonable.  My family is predisposed to Glaucoma and Diabetes and I fear blindness more than death itself.   Dr. Hagstrom picked up on this, and explained every test (and the results)  AND...Even though I had my retinal scan done (which was probably more than adequate) she also dialated my pupils and inspected each eye herself.    Long story ... L O N G E R ...  I get home thinking my eye pressure was in the 90 range as that was the readings I got off one of the tests.  Through google I learned that 20 was a normal pressure.  A tad bit panicked I called late Friday and left a message asking for clarification.   Dr. Hagstrom called me herself the following morning (a Saturday) and put me at ease and explained that the readings of \"90\" that I remebered were another unit of measurement for a different kind of test.   She gave me my eye pressure readings and they were in fact 20 in each eye (which is normal yay!)\n\nSo yeah.

The \"faux\" bq tacos missed the mark; I believe they were attempting something along the lines of a miniature puffy taco you can get in San Antonio and elsewhere around Texas, but it came off as dry and bland.\n\nThat being said the smoked wings were GREAT! Just the right amount of spice and with four big full wings (still joined flat and drum, so really eight wings) for $9, I was a happy camper.\n\nHeist aims high and certainly is a hipster hangout.

The whole restaurant has been remodeled, It used to be the courtyard Café, but it's now the copper whisk. We ate here a lot when my brother and my dad would come here to visit and stay at the Orleans and the food was great. The food is still great, an the customer service is still on point. There wasn't very many people there when we got there so we didn't have to wait. Probably because it was the middle part of the day. We were waited on right away an brought our drinks. The food came out quick after we ordered and It was cooked perfectly  an very good. We both had a club sandwich an my brother had onion rings and I had fries. The onion rings were perfect. I'm glad to see that the food and the service is still the same even though the place has been remodeled. Looks like to me it's a little bit smaller but I'm sure it's just because I haven't been there in a while. Love the new look, will go there for lunch again in the near future.

I always give places a second chance because you never know if the first was a fluke or not. My boyfriend and I decided to try Bonsai since we drive by quite often. \n\nThe first experience was perfect. Our waiter was attentive, our orders had come at a timely manner and the food tasted really good. My boyfriend had the ayce sushi and was mentioning how this place would be our go to sushi. He mentioned how fresh the fish tasted and how quick we got our sushi. I ordered the salmon teriyaki combo bento which came with soup, salad, vegetable tempura, shumai, salmon teriyaki, rice, and California roll. The salmon teriyaki was delicious. I wanted more! Our bill was around $50-$60, but it was worth it and decided we would come again. \n\nToday, Our experience was less than great. We had come around dinner time, but there was only two other booths taken. We sat down and was asked what we wanted to drink. I don't remember our waitress' name, but we wished we had the male waiter instead. We had asked for waters with lemon. She came out with just water, and then gave us the menus and a paper ayce menu. She was about to just take the paper menu and leave, but I had to mention that I wanted to order off the regular menu. I told her my order and I had to repeat myself and point to the menu since she didn't understand \"snow crab\". I then asked for lemon for our water and then she left. Few minutes go by and she tends to the other tables, 5 more minutes go by and wave her down and ask for slices of lemon. She looks as if she understands by smiling and nodding and then leaves. 5 minutes go by and I get agitated since I have asked 3 times for lemon. My boyfriend and I see the male waiter and when we asked for lemon, he came back very quickly. I noticed he was tending to other tables that started coming as well. \n\nA few minutes go by and my salmon teriyaki comes with the rice. It was flavorless. I didn't order the combo this time and was just expecting salmon, rice, and a salad. No salad came and the teriyaki sauce was sunken to the bottom of the salmon. My boyfriend made a comment saying I was suppose to get a salad. The waitress seemed surprised and asked if I wanted a salad. When I said yes, she left quickly and I didn't have time to ask for extra teriyaki sauce. \n\n30-40 minutes probably went by since being seated and my boyfriend didn't even get his sushi. We watched other tables getting their orders before us and even leaving before us! When his order finally came, his appetite was gone. We had enough of waiting and was just annoyed with out service. \n\nOverall, we give this place a 1 out of 5 stars. We had to ask 4 different times for lemon for our water and waited around 30-40 minutes for our food even though there was hardly anyone there. \n\nMy boyfriend noticed that on the ayce paper menu it doesn't have a time limit like other sushi places. We concluded that if there was a time limit, then there wouldn't be any time left to order a second time. \n\nWe are highly disappointed. I came home and started eating some apples to satisfy myself.","date":"2017-04-30 04:26:48"}

I had super high hopes based on what we had been told and how cute it was upon pulling up, but I was unfortunately not impressed. \n\nThe atmosphere is cute for sure.

And not just mine ... nobody at our whole table particularly enjoyed their meal (and we are talking 10 people eating like 6 different things)? The burgers were under cooked and juicing out bloody burger juice. The veggies on the burgers didn't look or taste fresh. My chicken was super gristly and battered with the blandest batter I've ever had. The ribs were dry and mediocre. Even the kids barely touched theirs? It just wasn't a good experience. I know we sent back two burgers to be cooked longer but with how busy it was and the sorts of issues we were having, the rest wasn't even worth trying to fix. \n\nAnd the thing that made this all even worse is that this place isn't too cheap? If I want to have a crappy burger or chicken I'll go to McDonald's and spend $5 but just my boyfriend and I paid like $30 something bucks for food that we hated and were literally so hungry we ate another meal at another restaurant about an hour later? You can eat MUCH better for that money.\n\nI will say their garlic fries were ok - definitely the best food on the table (which is kinda sad). And the chocolate shake was DELICIOUS.

Now I'm coming back to review LT, and I see \"update review\". Wait, have I met this one before? Definitely a lot has changed since then and I didn't even recognize it.\n\nThe breakfast burrito with carne asada was piping hot, the cheese was properly melted and the potatoes stayed warm down to the last bite. I'd say solid work on everything everything except the carne asada. A few too many pieces of meat were either too chewy or too fatty. Both salsas were fantastic. Red: smoky, balanced chipotle peppers, plenty of heat; Green: much more subtle in heat and flavor, but still worth putting a few splashes of it on parts of your burrito. I only wish they kept the salsas on ice, but having individual bottles to take to your table is also nice. At $4-4.50 for just eggs+potatoes and $6.50ish for eggs+steak, I think the portion size is just a hair too small. Don't get me wrong, it tastes fantastic and it was definitely filling, but other places don't mess around with portions. \n\nI'd say its a solid 4\/5. I haven't had as much Tex Mex due to living in NE, so I might be overinflating, but I also think the carne asada could use some work. It all balances.","date":"2017-10-24 19:31:23"}

After paying, in my opinion, extortionate fees at another vets office. From the first moment I stepped in to the office, we were greeted by friendly receptionists. I am very diligent went it comes to my dogs, so this first visit was secretly an interview to see if the vets here would be deemed 'fit' to take care of my precious Boxers (I'm not kidding either ;). After that first appointment, I left feeling incredibly comfortable with my new choice of veterinary care. Having Boxers means we are there frequently!! We have seen pretty much all of the vets there and they all know my dogs well. The staff greet us by our names and with a huge smile. Sadly, we have been through some dire medical conditions and even had to have one of my senior boys who was suffering with cancer, put to sleep. Throughout that whole 2 month process, I feel as though we were treated with respect, love and most definitely a shoulder for support. I would arrive for the appointments every time, in tears and everyone was unbelievably nice and kind. They offer a service where you can opt for the vet to come to your home while you say goodbye to them, and this is what we chose (twice now) and each time the doctor (and Wes, the vet tech) were awesome. The place is staffed with a medical professional 24\/7, therefore, on the occasion where one of my dogs might be required to  spend a night after a procedure, I know they are never left alone - something I absolutely could never allow! I am also a board member of a local rescue in town and we use CRAH as one of our veterinary choices for the dogs who come through the rescue. I have read some other reviews complaining of hidden charges etc and I can only say that from my personal (frequent) experience, every time we have been presented with 2 quotes - low end and high end, which is standard procedure with most vets in this town, and we were given an unpressured choice as to which additional procedures we wanted. I have explained many times that money is a huge issue for us, we don't have much therefore I need to keep costs as low as possible, however I don't want to cut out anything deemed necessary. I have never felt pressured or bullied or a bad \"mum\" when I have declined some services. As long as I have dogs, I will use CRAH to care for them. As a last note, after reading some of the negative reviews which are basically people complaining about having to pay for their animals medical costs, to them I say this, \"you own an animal by your own choice. The odds that at some point during its lifetime it will get sick or injured and need veterinary care, are extremely high. Either get pet insurance, or be prepared to pay for your animals well being, or, just don't get an animal if you can't afford to take care of it. Exams, X-rays, surgeries all cost money. Why do you expect to get it for nothing? Vets study for many, many years and don't earn that great a salary, which means they do this for their love of animals. They deserve to get paid, and you need to be respectful of that\"","date":"2014-04-19 17:15:55"}

(the app made me select one to post) the complete bs I just witnessed as a customer left me with a real stale taste in my mouth. This is the first dine in experience where the stale taste wasn't caused by the food. I went with my family to this location for lunch. The place was busy which is exactly what any good store manager would want; however a good store manager would also want their customers leaving there location feeling respected, valued, & fully satisfied with their dine in experience. Our experience started out great but it slowly showed signs that it was headed down hill when our burgers came to the table before our salads and shakes. We usually frequent the Parmatown location. They seem so much more professional. When our shakes were delivered to the table the chocolate shake made it to the table but the strawberry banana shake was poured into my wifes lap. As you can imagine this feels great in an air conditioned room while wearing shorts. The shake poured straight down my wifes bare leg into her shoe and onto the floor. My wife received a borage of \"I'm sorry!\"s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time. The most important question or worry during this situation is #1 How does the customer feel? #2 How can we help them? #3 What can we do to rectify the situation? In retrospect all we received was late food, apologies, wet pants, napkins, and a bill to pay for it all. Yes a bill! The manager came over attempting to offer apologies and a mop. Not once did she offer a solution to rectify my wifes ruined clothes and meal. I as her husband had to speak up and ask for some type of resolution. Some people have the knack to be a store manager while others just don't. This type of manager is what I commonly refer to as a floater. Floaters are managers who do just enough to maintain current numbers and current status quo. They really have no talent or abilities which are beneficial to improving the overall profitability or running of the store. When this location implements points #1,#2, &#3 they will be taking a step in the right direction.

I had two free passes for the Cineplex theatre so I thought I'd use them towards admission to the VIP theatre in Brossard.  The entrance is separate from the main theatre and it's 18+ since they serve alcohol here.\n\nYou enter and you're in the lounge area which is complete with a bar.  They do have a small concession stand selling classic movie snacks (popcorn, candy, etc) but if you're dishing out for the VIP experience treat yourself and order from the bar.  They have a variety of appetizers and food like burgers so you could eat a full meal.  My boyfriend and I were there a little bit early so we ordered nachos and raspberry mojitos to enjoy in the lounge area.  The SCENE card gets you 10% off the food but not alcohol.  The other awesome thing about this place is the bathrooms.  They're all individual bathrooms and they're super clean. \n\nSeating inside the theatre is very comfortable and there are servers there to get orders and bring them to you up until the movie starts.  One thing I love about the VIP theatre is that they don't seem to show ads prior to the trailers and actual film.  That is always my biggest pet peeve about going to the movies.\n\nAdmission is quite pricey at $18.75 a person so you can be sure I won't be coming to the VIP theatre every time I go to the movies.

Did a very short test drive and we agreed on the internet advertised price. The next morning I was looking at the paper work and noticed the base price had gone up over $1600. I called to ask about it and the guy asked me if I was looking at the total after taxes etc.  Ok. I don't know how stupid he thought I was but of course not!  I was looking at the base starting price!  After going in to the dealership to pursue this it was pointed out that the advertised price does not include mandatory dealer add on charges, such as window tinting (it was a used car and already on), nitrogen tires and other things that added up to over $1600. I guess it was on something I signed while getting to the desired monthly payment, but why wasn't it clearly pointed out?  And why dont I have any documentation or itemization of it in my loads of paperwork?  If I had in fact purchased these things I should have some sort of receipt for them. I think it's a horrible way to do business. We had verbally agreed on the advertised price and those add ons were glossed over and snuck in on top of that price. I have bought many used cars throughout my life and I have never ever run into this.  I will never again buy a car from a dealership who has mandatory dealer add ons.  If I see a price online I should not end up paying any more unless it is for optional items that are my choice.  Why would you even want to do business this way?  You've got a great line of quality cars. People will buy them. By looking at this site this same issue has made a lot of people really mad.

I've yet to ever discover the hidden treasure, but I keep on trying. \n\nAlong with the $1 menu, the lunch buffet seems to be the draw for most people.  I've only tried the buffet here once and doubt that I'll rush back again.  The restaurant is not set up well for a smooth-flowing buffet line.  There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding the direction the line should move, and I grew frustrated with the people who could not even make it through a buffet line without stopping to text.  What is wrong with people?  I imagined them texting the friend right behind them since nobody actually has real conversation any more.  And then when these chronic texters take the last of the tuna tartare?!?  Seriously? If you can't navigate a buffet line like a pro, you don't deserve the tuna tartare.  So let it be written, so let it be done.  \n\nIf you want sushi that is of consistent quality at a decent price, Ru San's is for you.  If you want a quiet date, it is not.

I'm not a restaurant owner so who am I to complain:-) The beef tips, baked chicken and pineapple lemonade had to be some of the best items on the menu, but I digress. The sweet potato waffle and fried chicken is pretty good, the waffle looks a little weird but the taste compensates for that. The mac n cheese can be suspect, but lately it has been on point. The fried whiting is very good but the pieces of fish are just way too big\/thick or something, maybe it was just that day. The fried corn on the cob is very good and highly recommended.

Our party of four was seated promptly and the service overall was pretty solid.  The food however, was short of what I would expect both at the price point, and given the reputation.  My wife started with the Bibb Lettuce salad and i had the mixed greens with goat cheese.  Both were so over-dressed as to be virtually inedible.  Two of us were planning to order the mussels, but thankfully the waiter quietly warned us off them as they weren't really \"in season\".  If that's the case, they should be pulled off the menu until they are in season rather than hoping the waiter does the right thing.  My wife had the Dover Sole special, which was de-boned at the table, but was pretty overcooked and dried out, (and was $55 for just the piece of fish!).  The Trout Amandine was also dry and overcooked as well.  I had the Boudin Blanc which was actually pretty tasty, but I can make a damn fine sausage and mashed potato dinner at home that is just as good.  The last entree was the roast chicken, which I'm told was fine, but pretty over-seasoned.  Overall, it was at best just \"ok\".  Not sure we'll be back to this one.

We ordered some garlic bread, 5 entrees w\/salad and some drinks.  The garlic bread was hot and delicious, salad was plentiful.  We all normally love the garlic dressing but this time found it to lack garlic. On to the entrees, the chicken parm was an overcooked sautéed, tough chicken breast covered in sweet sauce that tasted like it was from a can with a melted piece of cheese on top.  (no breading, no seasoning, no flavor), The chicken Marsala was topped with a plentiful amount of mushrooms but the sauce was thin, watery and tasted like vinegar.  The linguini with clams was inedible and sent back. Lastly, my 12 yr old daughter wouldn't eat the Spaghetti with meat sauce as it had no flavor.

This is a nail school in a not so great part of town;\n2. Because it is a school, the quality and consistency of the services is unreliable;\n3. Don't buy the Groupon. Call the salon first, tell them you would like an appointment, and when they ask about Groupon, tell them you were going to buy one. This will ensure you get an appointment right away, as they can only do so many Groupons per day, and they will honor the Groupon price regardless;\n4. The manicurists\/students are all incredibly sweet and friendly;\n5. This is a no frills, no massage chair salon (which I prefer as those massage chairs are filled with nasty, gross tubes filled with other peoples nail gunk that can never be cleaned out, ew).\n6. Make sure you have time to burn, my mani\/pedi took over two hours!\nI decided to visit this salon because Groupon sent me an email advertising their Groupon. I was interested in the gel manicure and spa pedicure for $25, as it sounded like a very good deal. I called the salon before purchasing the Groupon to check their availability. The asked right away if I was calling with a Groupon, and whether or not I had purchased one yet. I indicated that I had not, and they said that was excellent, as they can only take so many Groupon customers per day, but that they would offer the Groupon price anyways if I just came in.\nThis salon is located in a not so fabulous part of town, but I would hardly classify it as ghetto. If this side of town is ghetto to you, you clearly have never been to a real ghetto before. The customer service that I experienced here was on par with any other salon. They were friendly when they greeted me, offered coffee or water, and were all smiles. The women who did my manicure and pedicure were both incredibly sweet, and their customer service was phenomenal. \nHowever, this IS A SCHOOL. As such, the quality and consistency of the services are not reliable. I had to wash and scrub my own nails, and my manicure left much to be desired. The gel is inconsistent, wrinkled, does not cover my whole nail, and the tips were left exposed. It is simply awful. I was very disappointed with my manicure. My pedicure, however, turned out okay with minimal polish on the skin. So it's really just a fluke whether or not your service will be good I suppose.\nSince this is a school, the students work very slowly as they learn, so make sure you have time to burn. The whole mani\/pedi experience lasted over two hours, and I had two women working on me at the same time. \nI decided to try this Groupon because of the neat pics of nail art other Yelpers had posted, but that was a mistake. Do not come here looking for anything other than solid color gel manicures, this is not the place. \nOverall, even though this place is a good deal, remember what your parents always said, \"if the deal is too good to be true, it probably is.\" The stars I gave are for the students who, as I said, are incredibly sweet and well intentioned, but that a manicurist does not make. I would not recommend this salon, nor will I be returning.","date":"2014-12-17 23:04:18"}

I saved the best restaurant for last and it didn't disappoint, in fact, the food and ambiance exceeded my expectations. It was really cool and fun to walk through the pawn shop into the restaurant. I loved seeing all the guitars on the wall.\n\nBased on reviews, I started with the Tuna poke wonton tacos. I loved the presentation of the three tacos in a mini metal toast rack. The Tuna was fresh, spicy and flavorful and the tacos were crispy and crunchy. Simply divine!!\n\nBased on the fabulous waitresses recommendation, I had the Grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings. This dish blew my mind!! Creative and inventive cuisine that's artfully executed and presented. You get six dumplings served on individual lacquer Chinese spoons. The dumplings were delicious and bursting with flavor. I'd go back for this dish alone it was so good.\n\nNext, I had the Cauliflower which was cooked and presented in a small stone or metal dish that kept the cauliflower warm. The vegetable was cooked in ginger salsa verde with pickled scallions and had the most unique and amazing flavor of any vegetable dish I'd ever had.\n\nSadly, I ate too much for lunch and was starting to feel full. I was desperate to try the Thai style deep fried shrimp or the Short rib mac and cheese which were both highly recommended and sounded delicious. Instead, I opted to splurge calorie wise and get the KYGO Cloud Nine \"S\" smores. I loved the creative presentation as the dish was topped with a giant marshmallow cloud. I found the marshmallow overly sweet and it overpowered the flavor of the dark chocolate torte below. \n\nThe restaurant has a large, inventive cocktail list broken out into sweet and savory categories. There is an extensive wine list and about 4-5 wines by the glass in each category: sparking, white and red. I had several glasses of the Tempranillo. Prices ranged from $11-16 for most, which is really good value for Vegas where there are so many $18+ glasses.\n\nAmazing atmosphere and service!! Best meal of the entire trip. I will be back in Las Vegas in January and this will be my #1 restaurant choice and I'm already dreaming of trying the Roasted bone marrow toast and Oven braised chicken meatballs and savoring every bite of the big wow grilled cheese dumplings.\n\nMake this your #1 restaurant pick in Las Vegas.

We even switched times on them 3 times and they were pleasant and very accommodating about it.\n\nThe best part though was the staff and Dr. Stan Howard. He is great with animals and really knows his stuff. Spencer was thoroughly examined and then we even spent time discussing his diet and other concerns. \n\nDr. Howard is very friendly and pleasant. He is a very happy person who really appears to enjoy his work. This time I got to scope out some more of his credentials and learned that he was educated partly at the University of Pennsylvania - a very prestigious college. \n\nI enjoyed my visit with him and he took care of Spencer - top notch! He knows a lot about Wheaten Terriers  and their special dietary needs and allergies. He also treats many of the show dogs in the area too, so he seems to know a lot about all the show breeds. After this visit, I felt very confident in trusting my dog's health care to him.\n\nSpencer will soon be back (as soon as he heals) for his grooming and for the dreaded neutering. I hope after that visit I can give them 5 stars.\n\nAnd btw, he is unbelievably reasonable for an office visit and worked so well with us on addressing all of our concerns.

My first time consigning was NOT a good experience.  I brought in about 50 very gently used (some never worn)items. They were only used for my grandkids when they spent the night occasionally. I was told they were behind, call in 24 hours. I called back and found out they were only interested in paying me $1.26, two items. When asked they said they weren't interested because of fashion or condition . I later thought about it and realized I was donating summer clothes in October.  Slightly offended, I told them I disagreed but I would definitely be in to get my clothes to sell somewhere else. A few days later I come to retrieve my belongings only to find out that they have donated my clothes and tossed my storage bin. Now, I will admit I failed to read the fine print, but I do believe a simple verbal \"reminder\" when I reject the amount and let them know I will be in does not seem unreasonable. 24 hours from that conversation, I was told they put the clothes on their porch for a discounted rate to go to charity. I believe that it benefits them more to have clothes in front of their store to draw in customers than it does to have the people come back and pick up their belongings. It benefits them to not give you a friendly reminder. I was upset and surprised. The manager promised that the owner, Nick would be giving me a call to discuss my concerns. It's been a week and I have not heard from him. I will obviously not be consigning or shopping with other mothers again.","date":"2017-11-06 17:59:02"}

He called the next morning with the list broken down bit by bit. \n\nWhen I explained I'd hoped to have the truck back in 3 days, he expressed that while he could probably do it, it wouldn't be as thorough as he'd like and would I accept the offer of a rental car at their expense, so they could do a thorough and clean job. \n\nThey gave me a rental car, Eli was terrific to deal with. \n\nThroughout the next four days, Don emailed me each day with progress, and overall sharing that they were on-schedule. This guy is a complete pro from start to finish.\n\nOn pickup, he made the rental return as easy as \"didja scratch it?\", a quick walkaround, check of the fuel, and gave me the keys to my truck. \n\nMy truck had been washed (I kinda wish they'd detailed the interior, it was quite dirty but also disorganized and I can't blame them for attacking this mess). \n\nThen, Don followed up with an email, and this morning followed up with a phone call. My experience at this Findlay property was in such contrast to my experience with their RV lot, I simply needed to share.\n\nYou can read about my RV experience at: https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/findlay-rv-las-vegas?hrid=8BMTgU2mXlFOEhle3rMxKA\n\nWith people like Don Pagel, it's no wonder that the vast majority of the reviews for Findlay Chev on this site are stellar.\n\nThank you Findlay.

That was a lie.\n\nI take my car in the next day and as I was waiting, I overheard a customer telling the men at the front desk her brand new brakes she just purchased and had installed at this Meineke were grinding and making an awful noise. (I should have left then, considering I too needed brake service). I made the mistake of staying.\n\nMy car is looked at by one of the \"mechanics\"who calls my boyfriend and I outside to tell us the quote, I see a quote for $997. How brakes and one rotor costs nearly $1000 is beyond me. But the quote wasn't the worst part. \n\nAfter I clearly disagree with the charges and opt to take my vehicle somewhere else, the man proceeds to tell me, he will not allow me to drive my vehicle away due to the condition of my brakes, and I would have to tow my car off their shop. They claim it's the law. However when I sign a waiver I assume all responsibility of my car and I also make it clear I am aware of the supposed danger of my vehicle. Meienke was not abiding by law they were trying to waste my time, after I disagreed with their bogus charges. Obviously they use this tactic as a way to get fools to just stay and have the services done there. I didn't and as soon as I said I still did not want brake services done there, the nice guy act went out the window. They were very rude and  condescending to me as I waited for the tow truck to arrive.\n\n\nI would never bring my car here again. These are not true mechanics. They are just a bunch of men who take advantage of unsuspecting people by charging them more money than their services will ever be worth.

After having a few spoonfuls of the broth and bites of noodles, I ended up just eating the broccoli, bok, and most of the chicken.\n\nWe split an order of the spicy pork vietnamese springrolls.   Now, those were awesome!  The rolls were nice and stuffed.  The dipping sauce that they come with, spicy and slightly sweet.  Throw some chili paste on them and they're perfect!  If I had known that the pho would have been such a disappointment to me, I would have ordered the springrolls as my entree.  \n\nWill I return?  I think so.  But just to get an order of the spicy pork springrolls.  :)","date":"2012-01-03 20:33:08"}

They break the sections of the store up by sport\/exercise type. There is running, gym\/training, skiing, yoga, and general outdoors apparel. I love all of their clothes and appreciate the quality Athleta offers. Their twist hoodies are perfect for running, I love their sports bras, and their pants are comfortable to workout in as well as flattering. \n\nI am a loyal fan of the twist hoodies and will most likely end up buying every color. They fit very close to the body, have awesome sweat wicking material and also boast being \"anti-stink\" therefore you can wear their clothes longer before having to wash - which is convenient as well as eco-friendly.  Another thing I love about Athleta is their guarantee to their customers, one can take off the tags, work-out in the clothes, and if not happy for any reason can return the items no questions asked. I think they call it their sweat guarantee.  I read about a woman who accidentally threw her yoga pants in the dryer after owning them a year. She took them to the store to ask how to remove the pilling that happened and they told her to just get a new pair, on them. \n\nWow.

It seemed like they had a few things on the menu that stuck out.\nThe ambiance: Seems really \"date-nightish\". Dim warm yellow pendant lantern lights and candle light. The booths where long and spacious, so you have lots of room, but also high, so you feel like your in your own little spot, not being crowded.\nThe taste: The all important taste test. I am a burger guy for sure, so I ordered the Black Label Burger. The composition was ok... They put the vegetables on the side, so the cheddar cheese sticks to the bun which makes it hard to pull apart. I think the burger may have under-seasoned because it had little flavor other than the bacon and unseasoned beef. They also don't pat the bacon dry before putting it in the burger, and the burger was really juicy, which is a good thing, but it ended up being very greasy and soggy by the end. Nothing was unappetizing or gross, but I think all in all, it may be best to look for something somewhere else.","date":"2017-12-15 23:14:56"}

They also bring you plenty of kimchi and kong-namul (bean sprouts) which they'll grill for you to enjoy with the meat.\n\nAt the end of your meal definitely ask for the fried rice (I think it's a little extra). They'll add rice, eggs, veggies, and whip you up some kimchi fried rice with whatever meat you still have grilling. Yum!\n\nAs this was the first AYCE KBBQ I discovered in Las Vegas, I would come here until I discovered Tofu Hut.

We approached the hostess stand to the right (if you're standing in front of the restaurant) and the girl snarled, \"You need to put your names in over there,\" pointing to the other hostess stand to the left (basically just a counter where menus were spread out).

After a couple minutes I cleared my throat, she looked up and said, \"Um, are you dining in?\"  I said, \"Yes, we were hoping to, but we've been standing here for almost ten minutes.\"  Not even the grace for a perfunctory apology, she grabbed two menus and stalked into the restaurant.

I don't know what to say about the third roll, a baked roll, because it never came.  We waited and waited... our waitress disappeared.  She finally showed up and we asked for the check, which of course, included the missing roll.  We explained that we didn't receive it and asked her to take it off the check.  She was embarrassed, very nice, about it, but explained that \"the first one got burned and they are trying to make you another one.\"  Really, 30 minutes after our food came out?

I don't know how HE does business, may be starting really high on a price typically get's him the amount he wants consumers to pay, but that does not work with me. \nNeedles to say, I will be going to another dealership, just annoyed that I have wasted my time here.","date":"2015-10-17 05:03:51"}

Our waitress, Cathy, was very friendly, professional and attentive. \n\nAppetizer of small sampler platter and grape leaves were incredible. For our main meal, I had the chicken sampler over rice with grilled pepper, while my wife had the Turkish lamb chops over rice, both were wonderful; there were no leftovers. For dessert, we split their rice pudding (and I'm a sucker for rice pudding). \n\nNear the end, the owner stopped by to see how we enjoyed dinner. He asked if we tried the baklava, and when he heard we hadn't, he went back to the kitchen and brought out two small pieces, perfect for sampling. Needless to say, it, too, was amazing. \n\nIf I had one complaint it would be the fact that parking is at a premium in that location. We found a spot around the corner on a residential street.  Just take care not to block a driveway or park in front of a hydrant. Not that big of an issue, I was able to walk off the baklava after dinner. \n\nThank you for a great experience and an even better dinner. We'll definitely be back...

Everyone was really sweet and professional, but honestly, if I knew my hair was going to be half-a** blow dried and then curled with a straightener, I would have done it myself. My hair is really long and my stylist used a 1\" straightener and PULLED SO HARD to curl my hair, leaving these juvenile spin-y curls. It's just not flattering for long hair. I was hoping to have it styled with the brushes and less so with any hot irons. Also, I watched my styled literally put 4 products in the palm of her hand before into my hair. FOUR! That's not right. I am giving three stars because the service itself was great, but the techniques were poor.

And here is the reason why... We recently moved to Mountain's Edge and were in search of a new groomer for our 2 dogs (Dachshund terrier and Poodle mix). We saw the reviews for this place were good so decided to give it a try. They called us back in the expected time frame (about 5 hours). The dogs seemed fine and groomed. They did miss a couple of areas for our Dachshund (they missed his left ear and chest), but we didn't have any major complaints so we decided to take them again a few months later. The next time we went, it was my sister who paid and picked-up the dogs. When she was paying the tip for the groomer, the check-out girl saw the amount of tip and gave my sister a nasty look and asked if that was all the tip she was giving the groomer. My sister thought $30 for 2 small dogs for a simple hair and nail trims were enough (I have to mention that they are both well behaved dogs, and we have never had any complaints or problems with groomers, vets or people) And even if the tip wasn't enough, the girl should have not given her a dirty look and judged her. Ever since then, my sister refuses to take our dogs and her own dog to Barking Dogs. Not only because she was personally offended, but because she was afraid that they were going to mistreat our dogs for what they considered a \"not enough\" tip. The total for the 2 dogs was $90. We tipped more than 30%. We are now driving all the way back to our original groomer, Petiquette, where the owners and staff are friendly and they don't judge you for how much you tip, and where our dogs are well groomed and taken care of.","date":"2014-11-12 21:08:34"}

I emailed them again, this time asking more forcefully to be removed from their list and received no reply - just more spam over the next month or two. Tonight I emailed centurylink, their email host, and reported them for spamming.\n\nEast West Pizza - two stars for mediocre pizza that I never feel the need to taste again, minus one star for being spammers.","date":"2012-07-16 04:45:40"}

The stew with packed with big chunks of very tender tasty meat but instead of corn bread a tortilla was given . \n\nI had the chopped salmon salad and was surprised that the fish was a smoked fish and I think the menu should have said that and I do wonder if we didn't order the pretzel fondue if I would have received a roll or fancy cracker with my ($13) salad bread or cracker didn't come with it . \n\nMy salad was an Above Average Salad instead of the normal mix of greens the base of salad was marinated Kale and the other components of the salad were roasted cauliflower , currants and Marcona Almonds dressed perfect not too much . For my taste I would have preferred the cauliflower roasted crispy and maybe one other component to cut the rich fish and moist cauliflower . \n\napprox $45 (before tip) soda , ice tea pretzel fondue , beef stew , salad (lunch time)","date":"2011-03-20 13:40:25"}

Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Madison and my hands down 1st choice for quality sushi in Madison. First of all this place is located in the Hilldale mall near a lot of great shops. Yes there isnt much parking near the restaurant but there is always parking in the Hilldale parking lot. The place has a great vibe to it, very modern. I've eaten here a number of times and all of their rolls are superb. Maybe once out of the 20+ times I've eaten here the unagi wasnt that great but it was only once.  Yes its kind of pricey but they do have discounted sushi specials for chefs choice during lunch and dinner. They have great options for small appetizer dishes that are super yummy and a lychee martini that is killer. The sake selection is kind of pricy but all really great quality. Anywhere else I would give this place a solid 3 stars but since Madison has so many limited options for great sushi I'll add another star. I'm so glad this place exists in Madison!","date":"2011-04-22 05:34:56"}

My boyfriend, his best friend, and I decided to check this place out after finding out the AYCE Chinese Buffet next door turned into a Dim Sum a la carte restaurant. The place was fairly cramped with the booths real close to your gut. It was almost like my man boobs were actually sitting on the table when we were done. We all decided to get the AYCE sushi dinner (1 hour time limit), which was fairly priced.\n\nThe service was fast and so was the sushi that came from the sushi bar for the first 15 rolls. Most of the flavors seemed to have originated from Korean style, Kim chee especially the ahi poke. 90% of the rolls that came to the table were drenched or overly sauced. When I go to a Japanese restaurant, I expect my sushi to come out fresh, with natural flavors. So all the sauces on these rolls today, is masking the low quality fish.\n\nThe last 5 orders depreciated the ratings of this place.  They should watch the quality of all their products, especially the \"mini beef platter\", the meat tasted past due. So guess who had the runs for the past day and a half? So I didn't know if the meat was actually meant to be on the fermented side, cause the whole Korean influence, or they were trying to sneak away with serving the meat til it was sold out so their food cost wouldn't be so high. There was a sushi roll that had corn and grilled onions on top of it, like who does that? With over powering, mayo based sauce drenching the rolls underneath, It would be awesome if all their rolls came with a description of what's inside or on top, My boyfriend is allergic to tomatoes, citrus, and onions. So then my ramen came out. I was thinking it would be a homemade ramen noodle, with a nice broth. Nope, top ramen, Kim chee flavored, with a sprig of green onion, dusted with more Kim chee seasoning!\n\nIf. It weren't for the e.coli infested beef tips, the drenched and soggy rolls, the mediocre tempura ice cream, and the southwestern, over kill on the onions on top of the sushi, or the imitation ramen, I'd given this whole in the wall a higher rating!","date":"2015-06-09 05:01:00"}

I love their food! Their food is great but my last 2 visits (1 to the Riverview location and most recently the Higley location) left me extremely disappointed due to menu changes and inflexible customer service. \n\nA few months ago at Riverview, I requested to make a substitution in an item that came with a new meal offering of their's that I wanted to order. My server told me it was not possible. (I'd like to note the young man was not my regular server, an awesome lady from Crotia who's terrific at her job!) The item I wanted sold a la carte for the same price as the item included in my meal. I even offered to pay a buck or two upcharge in order to get what I wanted but the server refused. I asked to speak with a manager several times but one never came to my table. I ordered something else and continued my request to speak with a manager who never came despite my server's reassurance that he would. I haven't been back since. \n\nToday, I stopped at the Higley location, ordered a burro with a side of sour cream and a drink. I've ordered this burro by itself numerous times over the past several years (most recently last month) but today I was told it now comes with choice of beans or rice. They could not sell me just the burro. After much insistence that I did not want either, a lady working behind the counter told cashier and me that I didn't have to take the side but they couldn't adjust the price. I thought she might offer to comp my side of sour cream or my drink in exchange; but no such luck. So, $10.69 for a burro and a drink! I just find it difficult to spend hard-earned money and either not be able to get what I want or feel taken advantage of. \n\nMatta's, it's been a nice run with you but I won't be coming back.","date":"2014-06-28 00:31:46"}

The building is split into two venues.  One side is the coffee side.  It opens for those who need an early coffee and maybe a pastry.

The coffee is their own and  is roasted on the premises.  I love the smell of it when I drive through the town.  Their coffee offerings are equal to what you would find at Starbuck's but they also have some items unique to them.  Their \"Mocaffe\" (Mexican spiced hot chocolate) is one of my faves.\n\nThe wine side is open for lunch\/dinner time.  The menus are small, and most items would be considered appetizers.

I've never had bad sushi or service. I've even had lots of take-out that was tasty when I got it home. \n\nSome things in particular that I like: \n\n1) Thank you Pacific East for your low prices. You make eating healthy, tasty sushi on a budget possible. Especially back when I literally had barely enough money to live. Yum.\n\n2) Fast, friendly service. I know I can always hit up Pac East for a quick bite to eat before I have to go do something else. \n\n3) Good quality food that is consistent. Nothing is worse than varying dishes that you love the first time around, but the second just sucked. \n\nThe only downside I can see about Pacific East is really just the parking situation on Coventry. There's limited street space, I never have change for the dang meters in the garage, and the Cleveland Heights police department loves to write parking tickets. But hey, that pretty much goes for any business on that street.","date":"2010-10-05 18:49:52"}

The cucumber mule, which they have on tap, was entirely too sweet and I ended up trading it in for a glass of prosecco. The brussel sprouts were tasty, but not anything special. The BBQ pork stuffed macaroni shells were a flavor combination that didn't work, the pork was too sweet, and the white cheddar cheese sauce had an odd texture, bordering on slimy. The Caesar salad was ok, but, due to their anything-goes coursing style, was the last dish we received. Again, nothing special.

I've always driven past it and wondered what it was like, but since she gave it such a great review, I thought I'd give it a go. \n\nThe restaurant has a sort of Parisian cafe feel to it, with mismatched chairs and some booths and tables, and a mural on the wall. Upon arrival mid-Saturday afternoon, we were also presented with 3 menus, breakfast (which was ending shortly), sandwiches and another menu which appeared to be dinner options, priced $16 - $24 range. My friend and I both selected from the sandwich menu. \n\nI ordered the BLT, but having noticed that they served peameal bacon for breakfast, asked if I could have peameal on my BLT, they obliged, no problem. My friend ordered the meat loaf sandwich and we both ordered the sweet potato fries. \n\nService was fast, there were only 2 other occupied tables in the restaurant. I was expecting an average sandwich, didn't really figure you can screw up a BLT, er...thought wrong. The peameal was overcooked, and very dry, and it was served on 'white' bread, no egg or challah bread to be found here!! I was disappointed. The whole sandwich was dry, I asked for mayo, and the waiter said there was already mayo on it, I opened it up and the thing was bare. I showed him, and said, \"Umm, actually there's not...\" (awkward...) \n\nMy friend's meatloaf sandwich was a mess!! First she had asked for no onions, was allergic to them, and upon receiving the sandwich, had to proceed to pick off somewhere in the range of 7-8 pieces of red onion off of her sandwich!! The problem with the sandwich was just that it was a complete mess. It was on a regular bun, and gravy was poured over the meatloaf and the other half of the bun was placed on top. On service, the bottom part of the bun, is soaked, drenched in gravy, making it impossible to pick up! It was just a mess, I think it would be a much more successful item choice if perhaps it was served as an open faced meat loaf sandwich, with the gravy in a boat on the side that you pour on yourself at the time you are going to eat it, so that the bottom bun doesn't disintegrate. \n\nAs if our food quality wasn't bad enough while we were attempting to salvage a meal out of it, our entertainment was listening to our waiter bicker with the other waitress about table assignment and allocation of tips and how unfair she had been. The disagreement got quite heated and their voices were raised, creating quite a bit of tension in the restaurant amongst the customers, or at least, that was my perception. \n\nOverall, I was not impressed with the food or the service of this restaurant. I would not recommend it. I will not be returning to try their breakfast or brunch, or even to give it a second chance. Unfortunately, that was my very first and last visit. You know what they say, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.","date":"2009-05-20 05:11:34"}

Ultimately a hotel is a place to sleep and this one was pretty good at that. And it was a reasonable price for being downtown.

So remember to lock your door when you leave! We didn't realize this initially\n - the suites with kitchenettes are handy, modern, but very ikea. \n - the rooms are incredibly hot. The little home sized air conditioning unit doesn't quite do the trick. \n - our shower plugged up and wouldn't drain on first use. I went down to front desk, they were very pleasant and said they'd send someone the next morning, that they couldn't switch us rooms because the hotel was fully booked. Understandable. At 2pm the next day someone came to look at our shower. Good thing I'd found the plunger labeled 'for shower\/sink only' and fixed it myself because we had to be at a wedding by 3. \n - the morning of our checkout a woman knocked on our door at 9:30 to ask when we'd be ready to checkout.

Not knowing how to get to this establishment we relied on the directory. BIG MISTAKE. no joke it took us 20 min to find this place. After asking, and looking at several directories ( that show \"you are here\" backwards from where you really are).

Overall very good service. \n\nFood: we both had Caesar salads that were very good. I had chicken parmesan which was great and my wife had chicken Marsala. It was honestly very good food. \n\nOur bill came and it was \"cheap\" for Vegas, around $80 or so. Considering we had great service and good food I put $120 bucks in the binder and we finished our drinks.

I remember seeing this place open up near my apartment. Didn't look like much but me being the way I am insisted on trying it. Apparently it's everything I ever dreamed of: asian buffet (good quality food as opposed to the crap you find on most asian buffets), and ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI!\n\nWhen I found out about the ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI I kinda felt unnerved at the idea, presuming it would most likely be pretty gross. Man was I ever proved wrong. I have eaten in a lot of Toronto's sushi joints and this place definitely has some of the best sushi in town.\n\nAs for the environment it is very clean. Washrooms are beautiful. Servers are all very nice when you can get their attention. Though they have gotten better. When we first started going in we were some of their first customers so we got astounding service. When the pace started to pick-up though we noticed the quality of service diminish. But they have made some good improvements. They're a new business so I'll give them a break this time I guess.\n\nIf there were any quirks about the place I'd have to point out it would be their hilarious selection of music. Some nights you will go in and it will be good ol asian music straight through. But other times we have been in there you get the classic asian music mixed with unbelievably random songs ranging from forgot about dre (Dr. Dre and Slim Shady) to what I think was a bootlegged Iron Maiden song. \n\nAll in all one of my favourite spots in the city if your looking for a good meal for an awesome price.\n\nSpeaking of price, lunch is from 1100-1600 and costs $10 for the buffet. After 1600 its $14. On weekend add $2 to both of those prices.\n\nAlso, Oishi Sushi was just recently licensed to serve liquor and their beer is dirt cheap at less than $4 a bottle (domestic)!!!\n\nIf your ever up in the Downsview area be sure to hit this place up. Would recommend over any Wasabi and maybe even over the Mandarine with Oishi Sushi introduction of Crab Legs to their dinner buffet!","date":"2009-05-21 16:20:42"}

The shower heads have been broken on several occasions as well.\n\nI have also discovered that the after-work classes (5pm, 6:30pm and 8pm) get extremely packed and smelly. Luckily, I've been able to avoid those. \n\nThe lobby area, the practice room and the staff have remained alright, but the bathrooms really turn me off from continuing here now.","date":"2012-03-01 04:14:09"}

After the asking the staff at the counter (who seem preoccupied socializing) we registered and were told to wait for our names to be called. In our group of 8 we were paired with another group of 7. No one asked us if we had raced before basically just \"watch this video\". The other group was clearly more experienced and very aggressive throughout our entire race. One of the racers actually got ejected from the race. We had paid for two races and after our first one were escorted out of the area.

The burgers were good, but for $11-15 by themselves I'm not too sure. Maybe I'll try the kobe beef next time. The shakes are pretty good too.

Meaning....the low level of nicotine in the tobacco is not satisfying at all!  I can smoke 3 cigs in a row....and barely feel like I got any nicotine.  And the shit inside the tobacco burns like a god damn forest fire!  It smells like wood or plastic or I don't know what.  They smoke like crazy!  And they burn a lot faster too!

And try to explain this to someone that works at these places who doesn't even smoke....is like talking to the wall.  I know the owners have got to know that this tobacco really sucks now.  But I guess they figure...you get what you get.  Clearly they are getting much cheaper tobacco than in the past.  It's almost like it's 30% normal tobacco and 70% who the hell knows?

Everything was fine up until the part where people actually eat, which is a major issue being a restaurant. Two distinctly different dishes were ordered; yellow curry with tofu and Seafood Delight. Hers came out in a reasonable amount of time. I told her to not wait for me and eat, believing my order would be coming out shortly.\n\nMeanwhile, a table of two came in, and was seated at a table that was in my line of sight. They got their drinks, ordered and started to eat\n\nEvery so often, staff would peek around to see me, sitting there not eating. Eventually, one of the waitresses comes over.\n\n\"Is everything okay?\nEverything except I haven't received my order.\"\n\nMinutes later...\n\n\"Is everything okay?\nIs there something wrong in the kitchen? I'm still waiting for my food.\"\n\nHer response was that the order slipped through the cracks because of a larger party's (20+) order, which doesn't sound right. The party she was talking about was already seated and eating when we walked in, and the table that was seated in my line of sight came in after us and was already eating. Additionally, our order was taken on one ticket, not two (2) separate orders, so both orders should have been started at the same time\n\nMy plate finally shows up, but I'm so upset that I don't eat. For five minutes, I debate whether or not to ask for the manager. And again, every so often the staff would peek around to see me, sitting there and not eating. Was finally persuaded to just eat so we can leave.\n\nWe had finished our meals. The male waiter shows up, and asks how things are going. She had asked for a to go container, which was brought promptly. She filled the container with her leftovers, and the dishes were taken away.\n\nWe sat around for another 15 minutes. No one bothered to ask if we were ready for our check. That table of two? Already out the door. While we were waiting, we had a talk about her talking with management, because I knew she would be calmer than I would be. We go to the front and had to ask the hostess we would like to pay, but we never received a bill.\n\n\"What table was yours?\nThe table that had to wait over fifteen minutes for my dinner.\"\n\nAt that point, I pulled $25 out of my pocket, and handed it to her while taking her take out container. Was so livid that I told the hostess that she had something to say to management and I had to leave\n\nShe finally came out, and I got the lowdown.\n\n- A lot of apologies were given, but no real action to correct the situation (Which I take as, no one cares enough to follow up)\n- Of the three wait staff (2 F, 1 M) who came to our table, not once did the male member mention he was the manager\n- Lots of finger pointing going around: waitress(es) believed since the manager came over, he would take care of us; manager believed waitress(es) was still serving us.","date":"2012-04-28 16:02:06"}

Law students who really want litigation experience may want to consider it because this place screams \"sue me\" on a regular basis.\n\n1. LIES, DAMN LIES - The employees will lie to you, without a doubt.  I have lost count of the number of times I have been lied to while living here.  We were lied to about the ability to get satellite TV installed, about the state of our apartment on moving in, about regularity of the bus (forget it when school is not in session), the safety of the place, and about so much more.\n\n2. FEES WITHOUT SERVICES - The Village has no qualms about charging a fee for a service they do not provide.  We sublet initially and were told we would have to pay a redecoration fee and would have to leave at least two days between the prior tenant's move-out and our move-in so they could \"redecorate\". When we arrived, of course, the place had not been cleaned let alone redecorated.  When we asked about this, we were told that they never redecorate in sublet situations.  You should not be surprised to hear that the sublessor was not refunded her redecoration fee and neither were we.  In addition, a number of friends were assessed charges for things they had not done, including fines for leaving trash out.  Very questionable behavior.\n\n3. CRIME - Numerous cars had their back windows shot-out while I have been living here, at least three by my count.  The Village refused to do anything in response. \n\n4. THERE ARE NO SOCCER FIELDS OR BASKETBALL COURTS BEHIND THE VILLAGE - When we signed up, we were shown a nice diagram of Colbert park with all of its facilities, including a soccer field, a basketball court, and an amphitheater.  These things do not exist.  There is some grass and a hill, but it takes some imagination to conjure up what the Village subtly advertises. \n\nIf you're the kind of person who is willing to forgive all manner of misbehavior in exchange for a pool and pizza party every once in a while then by all means move in here.\n\nAs a final note, both the Village drivers and maintenance staff are perfectly friendly and seem competent enough.  This review is limited to a critique of the management and office staff who ought to be ashamed of their behavior.","date":"2012-06-26 00:48:34"}

Watched the same server take the next two tables while the other servers were doing side work.

I'd love to say that it's great but it would be far from the truth. For starters it is far smaller and they have half of there home decor items hanging on the wall half way around the store above all of the shelves so if you want anything you have to walk around basically starring at the ceiling just to look. If you actually find anything you want before you give up looking because your neck starts to hurt then you have to find an employee who knows how to get it down( I say this because it took 4 employees to figure out what they needed to do to get one picture down for me). While I understand that lack of room is not necessarily there fault but it is still frustrating and inconvenient. My second issue is with a specific cashier shanna. I come here multiple times a week as I have a small business on the side so I shop for specific items when they are 50% off so most of the things I get each trip are all on sale. The last 3 times I've checked out with shanna and every single time I'm not sure what she does( or doesn't do) but she might apply the discount to some things or other things that aren't even on sale, so my total is never correct. 2 of the 3 times she rang  everything up then said your total is x amount...

I was just here as last resort because the other places in the area were closed on Sundays. It's not that I expect friendly service from the person working at the counter but when your place is named \"Aloha\" Kitchen, you'd think someone can crack a smile and say hi when they take your order.  It's just not one time, it's consistently like this, no greeting at all!   \n\nThe food is alright, I do give credit that they plate the food attractively, but they rely too much on drowning their meats in sauce for flavor instead of seasoning and marinating it.  The slices of beef that did have no sauce were a little dry & tasteless.  The manapua I ordered was a store bought brand and the dough was a bit tough. (like they left it cooking in the microwave a little too long) . That's probably why you get your food real quick!! It's already been prepared all they do is reheat it!  There are at least 3 other places that serve up better Hawaiian & Filipino food in the area so aloha, Aloha Kitchen.","date":"2012-06-26 01:39:05"}

The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is that I think I love China Way (see my other review) more and its more authentic I believe. Everytime I have been to Pei wei though, I have not be disapointed. I have several favs. The honey seared chicken is amazing, as are the Pei Wei spicy beef, lettuce wraps, and Dan Dan noodles. The orange beef , pad thai, and chicken lo mein are pretty good as well but I rarely order them because I love the other dishes more. I love that you can order noodles with your entrees in place of the rice but having the option of brown rice is nice as well when I am trying to watch what I eat. Another tip if you are watching calories: you can get any main dish with the chicken steamed instead of battered and fried. Pei Wei also makes the most amazing crab wontons with the best sauce evar!!! One of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to crab wontons is when there is no crab. Hello, crab is in the name so it should be present in the dish! At Pei Wei, you can actually taste and see the crab in their wontons. Mix that with the sweet chili sauce they serve the wontons on and these are great! Don't get me wrong though, I've tried some of their other dishes that I was not a big fan of. Their thai coconut chicken was a little bland, the sweet and sour chicken is not what I look for in sweet and sour chicken (the sauce wasnt very strong), and the mongollian chicken had a strange flavor that I didnt care for. But to each his own, people have different taste. Anyways, Pei Wei is one of my favorite places to go and the prices are relatively cheap. I agree with one reviewer in why would you go to PF Changs when Pei Wei has the same food pretty much at a fraction of the price not to mention the portions are bigger.","date":"2010-08-21 17:26:54"}

We came in around 4PM to a restaurant that was not even half full and waited for a table for 15 minutes. When we got to our table we were left alone again for 10 minutes. We were pretty hungry at this point so we order a bit of food. The waitress gave us a stern look and told us it was too much in a more than your mother's naggy tone kind of voice. I assured her we can handle it. Classic rule of dining is that the customer is always right, even if they are wrong. I shrugged it off. \n\nThis hasn't been out first time to a Korean AYCE style restaurant but after our interaction earlier, I guess our server took it upon herself to make up our minds on how we want to eat. We tried to keep it pleasant and light hearted but she kept on getting pushier and pushier as the afternoon went on. At the end of dinner we had paid and left her a decent tip (18%) underneath one of the cups. We made sure it was visible so it doesn't get accidentally get swept away during the table being turned over. We were in our car and about to go when the waitress ran out to our passenger door and knocked angrily on my car door. I lowered the window and asked her what was wrong. Our astute waitress, still huffing and puffing angrily, said we didn't even tip her. I calmly said we did and where it was. She then replied with an \"Oh...\" and then quickly ran back inside. We waited there 5 mins to see if she would come out and apologize as I thought we were entitled one for the way she was acting and for leaving prints on my car window. \n\nWe will never return here. Never have I been so turned off at dinner by bad service. Had I known that that was the kind of service I would be getting I would have spent my money at an In and Out and got my money's worth and a smile to go with my chocolate shake.","date":"2014-07-28 02:57:29"}

Same great steaks and seafood (according to Hubby) and same great service.  We only had one iffy time while it has been Anthony's and our server corrected the problem immediately and professionally.  To preface this, we NEVER send back food but our steaks were clearly overdone; my filet was ordered medium but came out well done while Hubby's bone-in ribeye was ordered medium rare but, came out medium-medium well.  Again, I can't stress how well our server handled the situation.\n\nWhen we go out for steaks, we're pretty much creatures of habit, filet mignon, ribeye, or bone-in ribeye.  Steaks at Anthony's are top-notch and can rival any steakhouse on the Strip.  Steaks do come with complimentary sauces such as bearnaise, bordelaise, and peppercorn--try the bordelaise!!!!  Another thoughtful note Anthony's provides for their steak diners are the complimentary roasted tomato topped with parmesan and a petite mixed greens salad with a very light lemon viniagrette.  For those of you who like french onion soup, please note they must've changed their recipe when they transitioned from Terzetto's to Anthony's.  The french onion soup tastes like it has tomato sauce\/paste in it now; it used to be a robust beef stock flavor.  Sides are very good here.  I highly recommend their creamed corn.  Tater tots should be ordered only if you are having a very light dinner, as they're very dense and heavy.\n\nAgain, service is A to A+ and can also rival some of the most elite steakhouses on the Strip.\n\nThe contemporary decor in Anthony's hasn't changed much since it was Terzetto's.  It's still a very large restaurant with tons of seating options.  It has the oyster bar adjacent to it and a regular drinking bar off to the side.\n\nGreat place for dinner!","date":"2012-08-15 10:29:12"}

I've been here several times for breakfast and lunch with my boyfriend. We both really like the food when it's available almost every time I've been here they have been completely out of bagels( you call yourself a bagel shop).  I usually get the Tijuana Hot bagel sandwich on a jalapeño bagel which is really good. They make the food fresh right in front of you (except the bagels) I've had a few of their wraps too which were also good. So the food is great I think, I mean I've never had an issue with that, it is pricey for what you get a bagel sandwich ONLY will cost $7 no drink or side. If you get a meal you're looking at $13 and the portions are small, filling to a 5'1 105lb girl, my boyfriend usually has to get more food to feel full. BUT the environment is pretty gross, the tables are often dirty and sticky the place seems really unkempt, like they aren't really concerned about the appearance of the place at all floors are dirty and overall it just looks...well not super sanitary. Another thing is the service they are nice but not attentive, they get you your food and then they disappear. \n\nTo sum it up, the food is good but you don't get enough of it for what you pay. The environment is filthy and the service is fair.","date":"2015-07-03 21:12:25"}

You know how you start writing the yelp review as soon as you enter the place? When I saw myself all thoughts left me except 'christ I look good.' \n\nIt would be dismissive to give GwE 5 stars based only on their premise of Organic hair care and styling, but I might have done it anyway because I really truly believe that everyone needs to read the ingredient labels of all the products they use (hair, face, body) and really think about what dubious chemistry is seeping into their bodies every day. I will be a Green with Envy girl for the rest of my stay here in the Valley, not only because their business philosophy is ethical and whole-hearted but because they have excellent stylists. \n\nToday I saw Eric Flotta who was nice enough to take me as soon as he came in, even though I was half an hour early. And he didn't scream in horror at my post-workout hair, just led me over to the sink to start my wash\/style\/blowdry.  He told me about some of the organic products that the salon uses and carries for retail purchase and even mentioned that GwE uses the first and only hair color that doesn't include toxic chemicals. \n\nEric didn't do any wild and crazy hair makeover on me, but my hair does look very sexy and different. I like that he could take my frightening mess and turn it into something simple and beautiful in not a lot of time and with minimal product in it.  He recommended a product to me and though I am a staunchly opposed to buying salon hair care I did because it's organic and makes me look nice! \n\nAlso, they have a $35 women's haircut special which proves that earth-friendly organics can be luxurious AND affordable.  Now I want them to get some formaldehyde-free nail polishes and start up some manicures and pedicures!","date":"2009-03-03 20:34:46"}

The furniture here is contemporary but so comfortable and welcoming. I wanted to sink into those pedicure chairs but only had a manicure on my first visit. The salon is SPOTLESS. I was told that the pedicure tubs have their own disposable liners, which makes me feel so comfortable with how hygienic and clean this place is. \n\nJenny did my manicure and she was fabulous. Very personable and so meticulous! I chose a pink glitter polish but expressed concerned that it wouldn't be dark enough with two coats. She initially tried and realized it wouldn't be, so she removed the polish and started over with a darker color for the first coat. I so appreciated how hard she worked to make my manicure perfect!  \n\nMy only complaints are that they are closed Mondays and Tuesdays (I've been meaning to come here for quite some time but, ironically, the only times I found myself available for pampering were on Mondays so I missed out for quite a few months... finally, when I was off on a Wednesday, I was able to make an appointment).

When I was on the HCG diet, the food was amazing and all meals were made to follow the strict rules of the diet. I never knew 500 calories a day could taste so good.   \n\nMy boyfriend has diabetes and needed a low carb low sugar menu.  She accommodated his needs and helped get his diabetes under control.  Then he had his jaw wired shut after a medical problem, and she made all the diabetic meals into liquid that could be eaten through a straw.  \n\nI joined a gym called Raw fitness that gave you a meal plan consisting of healthy proteins and lots of vegetables.  I am a terrible cook and I did not want to fail on this fitness program.  Again, Murdock Meals came to the rescue and cooked for me per the instructions.  \n\nFinally, my boyfriend is currently in the hospital and cannot stomach the hospital's food.  I called Murdock Meals and he is now getting the nutrition he needs to get better.\n\nTo conclude, whatever your diet requirements might be, Murdock Meals can accommodate.  The food is cooked to order fresh, delicious, and affordable.  Even if you can cook (unlike me) and do not have enough hours in your day, I highly recommend Murdock Meals.","date":"2016-07-14 21:49:32"}

Our bill came to just under $100 - thanks in part to a $10 discount I received after joining the Canyon Club. My date and I had the Baja Fish Tacos to start - which were just okay. We could've done without them. Let me tell you, I need to find a recipe or recipe dupe for the honey butter they serve with their bread - it is to DIE for. I wanted to try their pasta but opted for a steak since most reviews said they have the best steaks in the province. We ordered the Chipotle Sirloin and it was really good ... a TAD bit too much oil on my plate but it was very tasty and cooked to perfection. I'm taking a star off for the rock hard veggies - they were barely steamed and quite raw - which isn't a major issue - if I ASKED for raw veggies. We ordered a pitcher of their sangria and it was really good - you could actually taste the alcohol which for me is a plus because there is nothing I hate more than a watered down alcoholic beverage. For dessert we shared their chocolate brownie and it was really good except when they brought it, the ice cream was almost all gone and melted all over the plate. Unfortunately with the extra oil and melted ice cream on my plate, I gotta take off another star for presentation - while the taste was there, the dishes didn't LOOK appetizing. Our server was really good and knew the menu well - when we asked for his opinion and input he had an answer at the ready. Toward the end of the night (when it was less busy) he kind of disappeared and we had to look for him to bring our bill but other than that he was really good.","date":"2015-07-28 16:03:38"}

The service is impeccable, the oysters are fresh, and the food is really good. However, I cannot give it that 5th star because nothing about the restaurant's food stands out per se (no pun intended Mr. Keller).\n\nI've been to Bouchon twice and both times I sat at the bar. I also happened to get the same bartender and this guy is so on top of his game that you would think he has been doing this his whole life. He is a courteous chap with a pleasant demeanor and offers good recommendations all around.\n\nThe first time I went, I had the french onion soup, the moules frites, and the pot de creme. Each dish was delicious and the french onion soup was especially good. The second time, I had a half dozen oysters (really, really good), duck confit, and pork belly. \n\nThe confit was a bit disappointing though it was cooked as well as any confit I have ever seen yet it was still a tad dry on the inside and a bit flavorless. I wasn't a big fan of the pool of nectarine juice it was swimming in either and that did not make up for the dryness.\n\nI highly recommend the Moules Frites. It is simply a bowl of mussels with a very flavorful white-wine\/saffron sauce and a batch of really good french fries.\n\nThe lemon tart was not so great. It was too tart and the texture wasn't anything special. This is something that I know folks can make better at home.\n\nOverall the experience was great. I love Thomas Keller and his creations. I love the service and atmosphere of the restaurant itself. It isn't overly crowded and sitting at the bar is always fun when you have a good bartender. However, I cannot offer that fifth star to Bouchon because I'm sure it's food can be so much more (and this is a restaurant review no?). Maybe next time...","date":"2009-08-03 21:30:04"}

Courtesy of a good friend of mine, this joint came highly recommended.\n\nIt's hard to miss the restaurant from the street with the beautiful purple trees outside (also found inside).  We barged right in, shoved two long tables together and waited for all (8) family members to arrive.  The dining space is huge! It almost seemed like after all the dining patrons have gone home the staff could easy shove all the tables aside and turn it in to one huge after hours dance party. A better analogy would be to describe the inside of The Village as a cafeteria, is that better?\n\nOn to the menu. A one-sided card with menu items listed there didn't appear to be anything over $10.00 on the entire menu; now you're speaking my language!  The hummus was eh, the pita bread was decent, and chicken kabob was ok.  Each entree comes equipped with it's own little mini \"salad\" -- I have placed salad in parenthesis because it was literally 4 pieces of lettuce, 2 cucumbers, and 2 slices of tomato; obviously not the highlight of the meal.  The chicken kabobs were decent, healthy portion of rice served with this dish (never a bad thing in my book), but you have to order the yogurt sauce as a separate side; I didn't therefore my chicken lacked a tad in flavor.\n\nAll in all there's not much to report regarding the service since it's pretty much a \"fast food\" type Mediterranean eatery where you seat yourself, order, pick up your food and grab your own drinks from the drink station.  \n\nIt's a cute concept but for me, not being in my neck of the woods and all I doubt I will find myself driving 25 minutes specifically to eat at The Village.\n\nPrice is fantastic, food quality decent, and nice purple trees?","date":"2012-04-29 18:06:32"}

The staff explained the next steps to my father and off I went to recover. \n\nRecovery was simple and I had absolutely no side-effects. No nausea, no chipmunk cheeks, no swelling or bruising.

In fact, I can easily say that the band made all the difference in the world. They are surprisingly high above the stage in the back and become an integral part of the show. Lora Kelsey and Sophia Monica are extremely sexy, talented and make you \"drool\" zombie style for more. Patrick Leahy is also a riot in his performance and you can tell he's an audience favorite. I don't think Augustus Scott was Zenoch this night but it was alright because the stand-in was brilliant. There was more \"gayness\" references than I need to listen to but these are entertainers and this is Las Vegas. It is well worth and more the box office price to see this production.\n\nI do NOT recommend getting the show\/dinner package. The restaurant they pair you with called Pampas Brazilian Grille are a bunch of jerks. They have two lines they put you in... one for show vouchers and one for walk-in customers.

Eric R. also got shrimp and a salmon avocado roll, Steve got kimchi, and we all split a wakame soup from the suggestions of Misti and Bobby.\n\nThe soup was pretty amazing, so I would go back for that in a minute!  The broth was flavorful, and it had long strands of egg (my kind of egg drop yo!), wakame and green onions.  They gave us 5 small bowls and we were all able to share it (and one order is only $4.50).  \n\nSurprisingly, the ribeye was least fatty of the meats but my favorite nonetheless.  The only dipping sauce I really liked of the 4 was the sesame oil that was seasoned with some salt.  Eric R. and I also got our own bowls of rice which was a great addition to our meal.  The meats overall tasted great, and I especially liked the marbled tongue.  It was a real treat that I am glad we tried!\n\nJen S. and I also grilled up the kabocha garnishes from the meat plate and that was actually a really great idea!  I did not get a chance to try the kimchi but Steve and Anthony seemed to like it.  I had one shrimp (hard to mess that up!) and one taste of Eric's sushi - this isn't the place for sushi but it was perfectly fine.\n\nWhen I return, it is wakame soup, tongue and ribeye for me plus the ice cold beer.

We went to Mimi's Cafe for breakfast for the first time in quite some time.  So many things have changed, and I'm not just talking about the revised, blander menu.  \n\nWe went on Memorial Day, a Monday, at around 9:30 a.m.  It wasn't very busy yet, so we were seated right away (by our server, in fact; I guess there was no host on duty yet).  There were tables scattered here and there with people, but nothing significant.  \n\nOur server was great.  He was very friendly and attentive...at least until it was time for the check and he was overwhelmed with the now-crowd of diners.  It looks like the kitchen and management are where the problems lie.  For breakfast, it took wayyyyyy too long for us to get our food (between 30-45 minutes), especially when the restaurant was not yet crowded.  We never once saw a manager; nobody when we walked in or out or walking the dining room to apologize for\/correct the food delays.  And, sadly, the food was just average.  Gone are the days when a Mimi's breakfast stood out from the crowd.  My ham and cheese omelet was nothing special and looked sloppily assembled.  We could\/should have just gone to IHOP for better, quicker food.  \n\nOn a related note, it seems the Mimi's Cafes I used to go to in Orlando have closed due to poor service and a decline in food quality.  It looks like Charlotte's is not far behind.  We won't be back.\n\np.s. The free wi-fi never worked for me either, which I wouldn't have noticed except we waited forever for our food.","date":"2015-05-26 15:39:22"}

I flew all the way from Seattle to Vegas to celebrate my 40th bday. Thinking, this place will be a good place for me, my sisters, brother in laws n husband a place to enjoy n celebrate my bday. Well, let me tell u.. we were so disappointed n wrong. I couldn't believe how poor ur management n security handle situation when u had too much to drink. Yes, I admitted had drunk too much that I did actually vomited inside ladies restroom.  \nNot to the point, that I made a mess on the floor or did not make it to toilet. I managed to walked n did my business inside ladies room. I managed to clean n flush the toilet to make sure it was spottless. \n\nAs soon as I went back to r booth.. one of the security guard was talking to my brother in law n want us to leave because according to him.. I was too drunk to be there. At that time, I was just sitting n drinking my water observing n thinking.. what the hell is going on. We left r booth n waited for r parties on the waiting area to take care of r bill. Again, this security guard told us that we can't be there n have to leave the premises. That time, was already getting pissed off n heated up by the way they treated us. We got to this place @9pm n listened to the live band(sounded good by the way) enjoyed listening to them.\n\nWe took advantage of they'r 2hrs unlimited drink for price of$47 Ithink.  We ordered drinks n enjoyed drinking. That's the reason why we were there for, right. Well, if u guys r offering unlimited drinks in ur lounge expect that u will have drunk people. I had fly me to the moon, mai tai n rum n coke. Hmm, 3drinks within 2hrs was not WORTH IT!! that 3drinks for me was enough that I had too much already n had already gone to restrm. Well, after 2hrs they told us we can't stay in r booth  n we need to moved. But if we want to stay, we have to order drink to keep the booth.  Orderd a bottle of bombay n juice just to keep r booth. They suck u up to order so u can keep ur booth. Again, why did u guys kicked us out coz I had too much to drink n can't handle myself(according to them) but yet, u offered us to ord more drinks to keep r booth. \nNot only we got kicked out @12:30 at night(still too early didn't even got a chance to dance on the dance floor). \n\nI found out next day r bill was $800.00. What  the f***, how much again for party of 8. Come to find out they did 2 separate bill. First, 2hrs bill unlmted drinks so about $400 plus r food chips dips maybe $500 + gratuity of course there were 8 of us 15 or 20% of r total bill. Had another bill they chg after 2hrs+gratuity again of course. Oh, wait there is more another charge for the booth we reserved but did not tell us we have to move after 2hrstotally shocked at this lounge.. billed us twice gratuity that's 40% no wonder r billed was $800. We didn't even finished r drinks that was ordered after that 2hrs unlimited coz u kicked us out. \n\nNow, u guys tell me if I was out of control that night.. as far as I know.. didn't say anything nor made a scene to get kicked out. The only time that I started dropping the f** word when I found out that we were getting kicked out coz of me. My only mistake was.. I had too much to drink n I threw up in the ladies room using the toilet bowl n did not made a mess. If I had too much too drink..then why the Hell do I remember all this.!! that's because,  I was not toxicated at all!! I think ur mgmt n security guard did so poorly judging me that I was belligerent n not able to contempt myself just because I threw up in the ladies rm. \n\nThx, blue martini for ruining my 40th bdy n made me think that ur night club will be an epic place to be. I was looking forward to celebrate n enjoyed myspecial day that night with my family but instead worst time of my life. A night that I will never forget..disappointed place to celebrate ur special day. Ur security guard looked at me like I was being belligerent n can't handle myself. Again, u can't judge a person just the way they look n act. \n\nUnderstand, protocol n security of others is ur priority. But also need to realize ur lounge serving alcohol will not expect that customers will not get drunk. I felt humiliated getting escorted by ur security which until now.. still trying to find out WHAT I DID WRONG THAT NIGHT.\nUr security need much training when to act or escort people out on how much they've drink. He judge me so poorly that I was not able to handle myself. I did not trash ur place, bother anyone nor I vomited in front of everyone. \n\nNot my recommendation to celebrate special day coz they judge u on how u look if u had too much to drink. My 1st time getting kicked out on my 40th bdy n in Vegas.. Way to go Blue Martini... this should be negative zero star but not able to post my reviews if i don't click at least a star.","date":"2016-12-19 09:45:33"}

You can get draft beer for either $4 or $8, peanuts for $4, and water for $4. (Though the latter two can be had outside the park for even less.)  \n\nYes, there is parking onsite for some of the patrons, others must park in overflow lots blocks away and hoof it in. Though, that's probably a better alternative than the absolute clusterf*ck getting out after the game from the onsite lots. \n\nSeating is about half stadium seats with backs and armrests; and about half the seats are cheap, metal-bench bleacher seats (and about as comfortable as sitting on a rock for three hours). Not to mention that virtually all of the seats are in the blazing hot sun until later in the game (but there's really only shade for those seats behind home plate). And when it's in the 90s, and there's no wind, it can get pretty brutal sitting in the seats - which would actually more suitable for frying eggs on.\n\nFortunately, the concourse from third base to right field is shaded, but there's not enough room for all the scores of people wanting to stand in the shade behind the green line. So if you want to stand in the concourse on a hot day, you'll get to play the part of a sardine (packed with all the other sardines) to a tee. \n\nSomewhat strangely, one of two novelty stores is outside the park (see pic) with portable toilets. They stamp your hand to get back into the park if you use the toilets or visit the store. \n\nOverall, it is Spring Training, and it's hard to screw that up, but what the Angels really need to do to upgrade this place is eighty-six those rock-hard bleacher bench seats and widen those concourses like a normal baseball park with some elbow room.\n\nOne thumb up and one down for Tempe Diablo Stadium.","date":"2017-03-27 05:06:18"}

Generous portions of all your typical fixings (lettuce, pico, guac, cheese, peppers) plus unique ones such as noodles (A MUST!) and \"crunchies\" (AKA those hot-as-death chips) are piled sky-high to the point one must wonder, how will these wonderfully nice people close this burrito?\n\nIt's a true art what they do here, managing to fit all those toppings into one tortilla is a skill most enviable. The tequila lime is my favourite, but my partner in crime swears by the baja chicken. I've also tried the baked yam (though don't be fooled: to heat it up they do toss it in the deep fryer for a minute) and it was awesome, again huge portions. The pulled pork is my friend's fave, but it wasn't for me. They have a large selection of flavours, as well as quesadillas that are built much the same. \n\nBe warned: the hot sauce here is super hot! The last time I got a burrito here I passed on all things spicy.\n\nSizes come in lil, large and huge, the latter of which truly does live up to it's name.

My girlfriend and I came to Fernando's after passing on this place many times. Upon entering we were greeted by the server and asked to sit anywhere we wanted. The place at the time was pretty much empty save for a small group and two couples. Granted we had taken at least 5 minutes to order but we had ordered in time to beat a rush of hungry customers as the venue filled up another 5 minutes after we ordered. 20 minutes of waiting for our food turned into contempt as we saw customer after customer order and get their food before we did despite us being there before. We wouldn't have left as 'quick' as we did if not for a small family of 3 across the way receiving their food, having finished their order and receiving their second order while we remained at our booth sipping on our waters having gone through our reading material twice already. The icing on the cake was that as we left the waitress made it a point to come out to us and rudely inform us that our server would have to pay for what we had ordered and that we had to wait because it was busy. Surely for someone who works in customer service one would think that the general principle is first come, first serve, especially in a restaurant.

I find myself with a empty glass often and I also never get another serving of soup or breadsticks by them noticing I always have to say something, which is annoying. Overall though the food was good as always.","date":"2018-02-23 23:20:52"}

The man said to drop the car off on Thursday night and leave the key in the key drop, he would get the job done on Friday. I left the car in the lot, dropped the key in the slot, and came back for it on Friday afternoon even though I had no phone call telling me it was ready for pickup.\n\nTo my surprise, the shop was closed during Friday business hours when I arrived! Nobody was around, the car had not been touched, my key was still inside the shop, and the phone number was going to voicemail. I left without my car.\n\nI called again on Saturday. Voicemail again. No car. Called again on Sunday. Voicemail again. No car. Finally someone answered on Monday. I told him I would be there to pick up my car in the afternoon and was told they would be closing early, and would be closed by the time I got there. Unbelievable.\n\nI managed to arrange to get my car back finally after FOUR DAYS. Luckily I was able to make do without it by bothering my friends and borrowing their cars when I needed to go somewhere, and had no emergencies, but imagine if I actually needed to use my own vehicle! Unprofessional and unacceptable. I would not recommend using this garage unless you are comfortable with not getting your car back for days with no communication because they decided not to work that day for some unknown reason.\n\nNo apology. No discount. When I brought up the fact that they left me stranded for four days the man on the phone said 'that's between you and the other guy'... I will never take my car here again.","date":"2016-11-21 22:31:02"}

I liked their frame selection because they carry Gucci, Dior, & Oliver People's but they are TERRIBLE at doing lenses. If you have bad eyesight and actually need glasses to do their job, do not come here. \n\nMy husband and I both got the poly-carbonate lenses with anti-glare and I was so disappointed by the quality. I needed my glasses adjusted when I got them (as everybody does) and the crappy lab that these people send their glasses to put on a cheap layer of anti-glare so that when they're adjusted, they literally melt and smear!!! Who does that!? I've been wearing glasses for 10 years now and have never had to deal with something so ridiculous. \n\nAfter my first fitting and my lenses got smeared, they sent them back and received the second pair a week and a half later. Those got smeared during the adjustment process too. Those were sent back and on my 3rd pair, the people realized that they'll have to put a cloth over the lenses to not get them too hot so they won't smear. What a hassel! This place is so far from my house and every time I need adjustments, I have to come back here in hopes that my lenses won't smudge and I'll be screwed out of glasses. I've had those glasses since last February and about 6 months in, the anti-glare began rubbing off at the bottom and continued to do so until my frames snapped two nights ago. \n\nMy husband's anti-glare actually got smudged because he left his glasses out in the car one day and then tried to clean them. This place offers a one year warranty on their lenses so they replaced them for free, but it was still an incredible inconvenience. I will never recommend anybody nor return here again. My father-in-law also purchased a pair of glasses here and had the same problem of the anti-glare wearing after a couple of months. So cheap. Go across the street to Lenscrafters where you pay a little more but you only have to wait one hour instead of 1 month to get a pair of working glasses.","date":"2011-06-29 03:35:51"}

The waiter said the owner takes particular care in ensuring the oysters are fresh shipping them in temperature controlled containers. \n\nDaughter got the crispy calamari and contrary to what I thought, the calamari is tender and served hot.  No hard chewy calamari here. The sauce is refreshing also, light and lemony.  I ate too much.\n\nMoving on to the salad. The ceasar is served with a Parmesan cracker. Good but nothing to write home about. Wife had the wedge salad, she said the dressing was a tad too watery.\n\nMain dish was a bit disappointing. My daughter had the clams and pasta dish. Clams were really salty...voodoo clams. The pasta was better. I had the Spaghetti and Halibut. That dish was rather plain.  The wife had lobster ravioli. She enjoyed it so that was the best dish of the three. Gnocchi side was good, slightly mushy but tasty.\n\nDessert was creme brûlée and chocolate lava type cake. Both were very good.

It's our go-to place for UFC events.  The place is clean & comfortable, with a nice ambiance and we've always had good service (even on crazy fight nights when the placed is packed).  We have found the prices to be a little high for a sports bar style menu, but when you consider they don't charge a cover fee for UFC events & sometimes have coupons, it's not too bad.\n\nThe food isn't 5 star amazing, but it's pretty solid for a joint like this.  We've tried probably about half the stuff on the menu in the years we've been visiting Augie's.  For the appetizers, the egg-roll-wrapped mozz sticks & pretzel sticks are the best of the bunch.  Their wings are run-of-the-mill & sadly they don't offer variable heat levels on the buffalo style (it's a soft medium IMO).  The burgers & sandwiches are mostly good, but not exceptional.  The best things on the menu are the ribs & pizza.  The ribs are baked\/grilled style rather than smoked, but they're super tender with a sweet sauce & fall off the bone.  The pizza is probably our favorite thing at Augie's.  If fact, I'd even say I was kinda shocked at how good it was when we first tried it.  The crust is a bit bready, but it really works with the sauce & cheese they use.  It's definitely worth a try.  Pro tip - order it \"well done\" to get a nice slightly charred edge.  For dessert, the chocolate brownie sundae thing is surprisingly awesome.  It's simple, but good & surely plentiful.\n\nAll in all, we're lucky to have a joint like this out in the far west valley.  They have friendly service, show UFC fights for free, and the food is above-average for this kind of place.","date":"2016-01-04 15:51:48"}

The fries here are yummy as well. \n\nThey have a good HH for beer. All of the beers they brew themselves, plus all local beers are $3 a pint until 7. The couple of beers they brew that I've tried were good (I really like the Orca, but they haven't had it in a couple months). They also do a \"lucky lady\" special ($3 for a \"surprise\" brown bag canned beer). Sometimes a few of us will try this. A lot of the time it's Keystone or Nati Ice, often times they'll have something good from San Tan brewery. \n\nIt's never been overly crowded when we come, and service can be hit or miss, but it's never terrible.","date":"2016-08-25 19:27:27"}

The oysters were wonderful. We all wanted to try the French onion soup, which they split into half portions for us (unexpected and nice of them to do). The bone in ribeye was perfectly cooked and very good, but the real star was the 10 oz filet. Honestly, I wish I had been the one to order it, because it was one of the best cuts I have ever had. The truffle mashed potatoes were a great addition as a side. \n\nOverall, the quality of the meat was excellent. I did feel like the steak could have been seasoned more. Other than that, no complaints here. \n\nSERVICE: Here is where things went a bit downhill. Lets start with the positives - first, the hostess was very nice and sat us at a great spot near the windows to watch the fountains. We were also visited by [who I am assuming is] the manager of the restaurant, who was very quick to respond to any requests we had. These two individuals were not only helpful, but very friendly and personable. \n\nThe negatives - from the very moment we sat down, I got the feeling we were being rushed by our server. There is a difference between being attentive and being overly pushy. Our table felt that we were experiencing the latter. Additionally, we all felt that both servers for our table were relatively unfriendly and standoffish.\n\nI was also unimpressed by the attitude of the individual who split the check. Two of us were in Vegas on business and needed to split the check so that certain dishes were included on different cards. For some reason, this was met with frustration. In fact, the server responsible for the check walked away from me mid-sentence as I was explaining how it needed to be split up. Not a great touch. \n\nOVERALL: The food and the atmosphere were very good. However, they weren't good enough to make up for the lack of personable\/helpful service that you should get if you're paying to eat at an upscale restaurant like Prime claims to be. \n\nOur family visits Vegas frequently but it's unlikely we will be back due to the service (and the fact that there are so many other great alternatives in the area). I would also hesitate to recommend this for business outings - no need to deal with attitude from the server over splitting the check when there are so many other restaurants who are more than willing to accommodate this type of request.","date":"2018-03-15 20:38:07"}

The first time I dropped in was for a take-away Nespresso\/ espresso coffee, which was quite good.  The second time I came by for a take-away salad, which was ok.  To my taste, most of the salads feature poorly combined ingredients, as if disregarding taste, someone randomly selected trendy ingredients like caramelized pecans to throw in with what-have-you.\n\nI considered exploring other things on the menu during their half-price evening specials, but discovered that it was only dine-in.  The ambiance doesn't really appeal to me, especially if it gets busy, so I didn't bother.\n\nThen, a breakfast special sign appeared in the window:  bottomless coffee, eggs, toast for $5.99.  No bacon or sausage.  Not the best of deals, but still convenient and good.  And mornings were not too crowded, before the high school students descend.  I found the breakfast to be a good start to the day, and the endless coffee was good and strong and dark-roast.  Even the music was ok.  For the price, I was willing to disregard the atmosphere with the big-screen tv and the smell of Pine-Sol permeating the place and interfering with my tastebuds.\n\nRegular breakfasts are just ok. I tried an omelette once which was overcooked.  I had the Huevos Rancheros another time and quite enjoyed that.  I don't quite know how it is possible, but much of the food doesn't have flavour.\n\nAnd then, they installed the sliding windows-- which is great-- but they removed the tables at the front windows and replaced them with sofa chairs and wee drink tables: I don't get it.  The breakfast special is gone.  The coffee has now become medium roast acidic diner stuff. The music is now AM radio.  I asked for extra salsa with my meal and was charged for it.\nI won't be back.

Before doing the work, definitely get a second opinion or you may pay hundreds to thousands of dollars unnecessarily.

The service advisor made it sound like it was urgent and we would be taking a risk if the work was not done. I took my car to a trusted mechanic and he said none of the recommended work needed to be done right away and some not for a long time. After hearing this, I felt like the service person was just trying to make money through scare tactics. I have bought 3 cars from this facility and have done service through them since then but now I will not bring my cars back again and I will not buy another car from them because I don't trust their ethics any longer! I understand the need to let the customers know what could potentially be wrong but they should also be honest and add when they really need to be fixed to give the full picture.

The negative reviews on this place's wait times and busyness should not count against it. This restaurant just opened no more than 5 months ago, it is located on the busy P83 strip with tons of people and near the Arrowhead Mall, and is only a moderate sized restaurant. \n     When my husband and I first arrived we heard the wait was almost 2 hours but for a party of 5+ - for just me and my husband we were sat right away. Large families\/parties need to realize that places that have just opened up are going to be super busy and have long wait times - its common sense. We sat at a small side table and were not too shocked at how busy and compacted everyone was. We expected it and were happy to see all the buzz around the place. Our waiter got our drinks immediately and walked us through the menu. He warned us about a large party that had just arrived and that we needed to put any pizza order in soon other wise it would be over an hour wait for a Chicago style pizza. \n     My husband and I wanted to go a different route and ordered a pasta and sandwich instead. The wait time on the pizza was not a negative strike to us - we knew hand making a pizza from scratch takes time and we were more interested in the other dishes anyways. My husband ordered the Italian Beef Sandwich and I ordered the Marinara Spaghetti while we shared the Giordano's Sampler. The food was FANTASTIC and i'll be posting pictures of it too. It was rich and flavorful with a real taste of care and love. The only negative part of the meal was that everything came out all together and quite quickly. I believe my husband and I waited just over 10 minutes to get our appetizers, salads, and entrees. Our table almost couldn't fit it all. I ended up having to not finish my salad because I did not want my entree to get cold. \n     Other than that my husband and I had a great meal and really enjoyed the atmosphere. We also appreciated our waiter and his thoughts in items on the menu that were best for us and our time frame. I will definitely be back to have more from this delicious establishment - but with a party no larger than 3 I think for the next few months.","date":"2017-02-19 06:58:29"}

The fitness center was well-equipped and clean, and I was glad that complimentary earphones are provided for watching TV on the machines since I hadn't thought to bring mine.

The pizza, though we requested it be cut in 8 (usually their pies are cut in 6), was cut oddly so it wasn't an equitable division of pizza amongst our party (so we ended up cutting some slices in half), however the taste was bland and the crust though well done on the edges, could have been cooked a bit more and tasted a bit raw.\n\nSo for a quick casual bite I would say ok, however this wouldn't rank very highly in my list of places to eat while in Vegas.","date":"2013-10-03 15:39:28"}

Since this could easily turn into a catastrophically negative review on a public forum I will refrain from writing anything more than:  1.  I should have tried the true staple Nopalas (I have concluded that finding this on a Pittsburgh menu is extremely rare) and 2. Don't rely on Casa Reyna's previous reputation because, for whatever reason, things have dramatically changed (possibly explaining our terrible experience?) ... do yourself a favor and go someplace else. \n\nLocal comparison:  El Paso Mexican Grill\nNot recommended.","date":"2017-01-14 22:40:15"}

This place has the feels... you know the feels, when you need a bohemian, tropical vibe on a freezing Montreal day, yeah, those feels! The inside is super tropical, yet minimalist and clean. I'm talking clean lines, white on green on pale green. It is a floral masterpiece. There is ample seating, you would never guess from the way it is tucked into a quiet part of bustling downtown Montreal that it would be so SPACIOUS! This is a great place for groups. The food was delicious as well! I'm always in the mood for a delicious vegetarian meal, and this menu has been curated well. I met my buddy from Austin for a light dinner on a Tuesday evening. I started with a Mango\/ turmeric lasso- which I'll admit was my least favorite part- WAY too much turmeric and not enough mango flavor. We had the quinoa fritters to start which were absolutely delicious! I need to learn how to make these. I had the LOV Burger with onion rings and loved every bit of it. My partner and buddy ordered two very good dishes, one was a zucchini squash dish that I don't see on the menu and I can't remember the other one. The food is what knocks this rating down a star. While my burger had no faults, the other two dishes didn't wow anybody. Still willing to go back here with some of my vegan\/ veggie friends who visit Montreal.","date":"2018-02-24 00:50:44"}

Our drinks, appetizers, and dinner. He asked us questions first what we were looking for or craving and what we didn't like. The drinks he brought out were so delicious and refreshing. I had a grapefruit drink and my boyfriend had a cucumber one. Sammy informed us that all the vodkas are in house infused with the fruits and veggies. Which is a good touch because they really were some of the best cocktails we had. Then our appetizer arrived. Sammy had ordered us the cheddar fondue which came with warm soft pretzels, sausage, apple slices, and of course cedar fondue. Shortly after or dinners arrived he order my boyfriend a burger and fries best burger I've tried since I moved to AZ hands down. Sammy had ordered me the skewers. That came with a little bit of everything. Chicken, beef, veggies and shrimp skewers. Also can with a red pepper dip and this amazing honey muster glaze sauce which I put on everything!!!!

I felt pretty ripped off spending such money for food that is barely better than mall pan-asian food.  Their snow crab legs tasted less than fresh (slightly fishy taste and lacking the sweetness of truly fresh shellfish) and it also had an odd sauce that reminded me of some amateur combo of ketchup-and-mayo-and-sriraca.  The Laksa Noodle \"soup\" had, instead of broth, a strange paste-like liquid base that was gloopy and unpleasant.  Their version of wasabi friend shrimp was no better than my local restaurant that sells it for half their price.

Beckett's table is an amazing addition to the Phoenix restaurant scene. I have enjoyed two meals here and both were equally amazing. \n\nThe true test for any restaurant in my family is if we take my father there and he does not complain. My second outing to Beckett's Table was with my dad and he did not complain a single time. That my friends is when you know it's good. \n\nI have not been very adventurous during my two times dining here, I ordered the exact same thing each time, with dessert for me always being a toss up.\n\nThe Beckett's original grilled cheese with that delicious tomato soup is absolutely amazing. The savory soup coupled with a grown up kid classic is a divine way to start a decadent evening meal. The short ribs were absolutely amazing. They are what carnivore dreams are made of. As if it could not get any better, then there is dessert. And as a person who always looks at a dessert menu first to decide if I want to save room, SAVE ROOM! I have had the chocolate dipped bacon 'smores and the death by chocolate. Both are amazing, but the death by chocolate is by far my favorite. HELLO NUTELLA PUDDING! I swear I still have dreams about it. \n\nI appreciate the GF options, I'm always on the lookout for places that can accommodate my little celiac sis. \n\nOne more thing to note: Parking is an absolute nightmare in this lot, I would suggest parking towards the other end of the shopping center and walking up to Beckett's.","date":"2012-01-03 18:12:34"}

The customer service is extremely poor, especially from one specific teller. I wish I caught her name. I have been a preferred customer for years and my family is seriously considering taking our accounts to another bank altogether. Don't expect to be helped if you don't arrive with plenty of time before they close - because they'll take their time to greet you to ensure that they don't acknowledge you until 7pm and spend time telling you that they can't help you because now it's 7:01pm. \n\nI was standing there behind another customer for at least 2 minutes before the open teller (who wasn't helping a customer while I was waiting) even looked at me. I'm pretty sure she was just waiting for the clock to turn 7pm so she could tell me she couldn't help me. \n\nOh - but that same teller still answered the phone and does business over the phone well past 7pm.. probably hoping it's a new customer wanting to open another account for her own commission.

There are several other foodie events throughout the week leading up to this one that are worth checking out.","date":"2016-03-07 06:02:02"}

The restaurant is small and you can find yourself waiting, but it's worth it. \n\nValerie is usually my server. She's wonderful. My boyfriend and I make any excuse we can to get to Yasu.

Don't think about it. My friend once told me she would \"literally die\" if she didn't go to Europe once a year and I was like, lady I have no concept of that. But now that I've had the steamed pork buns at Yasu, I sort of understand. I'd probably die if I didn't eat them once a month.

First, the 2 hotdogs we tried were: Fancy Francine and Kimchi Dog. Fancy Francine bit - it had a whole egg sunny side up with bacon and hollandaise sauce underneath. Tough to eat but tasty. The kimchi dog was a korean twist with kimchi, seaweed and mayo. Similarly, tough to eat but tasty. The buns for both were soft and fresh. Flavour-wise, the toppings were great but I found the hotdogs to be a bit tough to bite through - perhaps the it could have been cut a bit before serving. Fries were great. But by far the best and perhaps most surprising was the mini-donuts - we ordered a 6-pack of the nutella glazed with crush biscotti - wow - this was amazing!!! Donuts were made on the spot so they were warm and soft.

You have to actually order from the waitress and they get it and cook it in front of you. The problem is sometimes you want more of one item than another.  The items they have are very limited.\n\nThe reason why I gave two stars is because they only give you two small bowls of rice for an all you can eat .  Also I am Asian.  Just like most Asians, I eat a lot of rice, especially with all you can eat meat buffet. I don't know of any Asian culture where you get more meat than rice. After I requested a second bowl of rice the waitress actually warned me that she will have to charge me for an extra bowl.  What the What. And this is a SMALL bowl of rice. it is less than 8 ounces.

The restaurant is very cozy. Seating is limited, so I would suggest a reservation. The dinner menu changes daily, but overall, expect scrumptious seafood, pasta, and salad. First of all, the bread is delicious and fresh. We enjoyed snacking on it before receiving our antipasta  and salad. We ordered the Insalata Mista della Casa; the salad was the perfect blend of peppery and crisp greens. I would highly recommend ordering it. Both of the antipastas we requested were the standouts of our meal. The Carpaccio di Manzo literally melted in your mouth. The beef was incredibly fresh and sliced to perfection, and the Reggiano was a nice touch. The cozze was the best bowl of mussels either of us have ever devoured  (and I make mussels regularly at home). The taste was somehow delicate and full of flavor simultaneously. I can not imagine a better way to start off your dinner than with these two dishes. By the time we ate our main courses, we were already drunk on the flavors Dish Osteria has to offer. I ordered the Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare. All of the shellfish was fresh and cooked to perfection. The spaghetti was a firm al dente, which is exactly how I prefer it. Amazing dish. My husband ordered the Saltimbocca di Vitello. The meat was delicious, but somehow the least impressive part of the plate. The butter potato gnocchi was seriously Heavenly! The texture was like fluffy marshmallow, and the flavor - buttery goodness. If I could eat it every day, I would. The brussel's sprouts were sauteed well and incredibly flavorful. Overall, our dinner was an incredibly experience, and if we lived in Pittsburgh, Dish is a place we would dine at regularly. \nWe will remember our dining experience at Dish Osteria for years to come.

I think that speaks volumes about the establishment right there. I'm rating Bandera four stars instead of five because the prices were rather high for the size of the portions. That being said, the portions were what I would call \"a good size\" compared to say, Claim Jumper which has portions that are too large. Further, I think that Bandera could use a larger selection of beers and mixed drinks. \n\nBandera was packed, something that surprised me for a Thursday night, and while I was able to get a table for two almost immediately, the background din made it difficult to hold a conversation or even clearly hear the server. I enjoyed the darker candle and track-lighting lit atmosphere, but it might be a turn off for some.\n\nI'm definitely going back to Bandera, but next time I'll be prepared and not wear a ball cap, as they aren't allowed in the dining room. ;-)","date":"2007-05-18 07:28:47"}

The young man waiting on us apparently didn't  know how to use the slicer, and instead of asking someone for assistance, he sent us home with these bagels that are a mess and don't fit in the toaster, because we have one extra fat half, and the other wafer thin with just the topping.\n\nThis isn't the first time we've experienced issues like this at this Panera.

I told him tomorrow he would have that opportunity. the next evening we were back, greeted by a very friendly hostess and Rafael, who asked if we like pork and chicken. We were seated in about 30 sec. drink orders taken, chips and salsa on the table. don't get me started on the chips... (3 bowls).  soon after that our food arrived, WTF??? I never got a menu, Rafael said he ordered for us. we had the Puerco Ahumado and Chicken Al Horno. This was truly Mexican food at it's best. I could not believe the flavors that these dishes had.

Read good reviews by fellow yelpers of this place. I believe they just renovated the dining area as I did not see the broken chairs, sticky tiles, nor limited seating that some yelpers experienced. I was introduced to laminate flooring, new chairs, and fresh smell of paint. Also the fact that they were repairing the bathrooms during business hours was quite frank as you can hear the workers drilling away (it was really loud, quick tip may want to compete repairs before or after business hours). Now to the tacos, they were above average at best as nothing spectacular about it: cabeza, pastor, longaniza, and tripa. There was no salsa bar described by others but bottles of there salsa itself. I gave it an extra star as the price cannot be beat, $1.10 for the three tacos for tacos Tuesday special and $1.50 for the tripa taco! I believe all tacos are $1.50 on a regular day. Total paid was $4.90 for four tacos, which is unheard of nowadays as most tacos shops charge at least $2 per taco. You get more variety here and bang for your buck. Though it won't hit my top 10 tacos shops here in AZ, it definitely lands within the Top 20. I shall come back again and try the rest of their listed tacos!","date":"2018-04-04 05:50:28"}

The waiter in front told me to go in the back...and the waiter in the back told me to go to the front.  It is very insulting when you're a single diner and you see through how much they don't want you there, so I left.\n\nI gave this place a second chance today.  The seating was not very good.  I had the misfortune of seeing the waitress clean the Korean BBQ grill with me there and that was not an appetizing sight.  The seating area was also quite pathetic.  Because this place is linked with its next-door neighbour, the Chinese restaurant Made in China (they share staff, so they are probably owned by the same people), Korean Grill House's front seating area is tiny, cramped, and looks very unattractive, which detracts from the dining experience.\n\nI ordered one of the lunch combinations, lamb chops with BBQ chicken, pork and beef.  The order took a little while to get there, but it was acceptable.  The food was a wildly erratic bunch.  The rice was great (fat grains, like in sushi), and the pork chops and chicken chunks were both seasoned perfectly.  The beef was half a step below, but still pretty good.  The problem was with the centerpiece of the dish.  The lamb didn't smell the greatest, and as anybody who's cooked lamb can tell you, there's skill in getting rid of the specific smell of the meat.  And Korean Grill House failed.  The lamb wasn't tender (which is surprising -- lamb is usually tender by nature), and the worst part is that it's very, very greasy.  This evening, a good seven or eight hours after eating the meal, I'm still tasting some residue stale lamb grease in my throat, and that's not a good thing.\n\nI'd say, go to Made in China instead.  Cheaper food, faster service, better surroundings.","date":"2013-09-04 03:38:32"}

However today I experienced something no one should have to ever go through. One of the server's ( small lady with glasses) was really rude and embarrassed me in front of my friends that I haven't seen in a real long time today. The situation started because I was taking the rice off of the sushi because Lord knows it was just to much rice on the sushi role.. lol Sorry( I had no idea ..I had to eat all the rice on an all you can eat menu lol! ) She came over to our table super aggressively and told us she was getting us our check with her hands in the air looking exacerbated..I became defensive and replied we are not finished eating and can you please prepare another sushi role. She replied back saying no.. and if I do I will grab you a half a role. I said why?.. she went back in the kitchen where our plates were.. brought it to the front of our table around my friends and other customers!   Saying(you didn't eat all of the rice on your plate!!!!) at this point I was just mortified!!!\nI replied by saying  if i violated your policy.. pull me aside or you explain that I will be charged more and I would have totally understood! I immediately went over to the chef and asked is this how you treat your customers. He quickly apologizes for her action! He came over to the table to defuse the situation and the bad experience from his employee.\nPlease understand my rant.. This is one of my favorite places in the city to eat!! I tell all of my co-workers, friends, and family to go there. So to get treated like this was horrible! As we signed our checks I guess he sent her to tell us sorry.. but I refused to accept the apology because I knew it wasn't coming from a genuine place ( the boss told her to do it) \nAndy no one should ever be treated like this in any of your restaurants...

They are also willing to adjust the sweetness of the milk teas or re-make it if a customer isn't satisfied with it.  Will continue to come here and I'll definitely try other flavored milk teas and slushes!","date":"2016-01-30 03:33:00"}

A second is coming soon to Summerlin. Cafe Zupas has had great success in Utah and Arizona. They offer homemade soups, freshly made salads, paninis, and gourmet sandwiches. I was fortunate to receive an invite to a VIP party that allowed Frank and I to sample various menu items. All guests were warmly welcomed and encouraged to sample the Try 2 Combo, which comes with a whole sandwich, half soup and half salad for $7.99. The Kid's Meal Combo is $3.99.\n\nSalads are made in front of you as you order, soups are made fresh daily in Cafe Zupas' kitchen, and sandwiches are fixed when you place your order. It is quite the assembly line. I chose the Tomato Basil soup with Orzo Pasta, topped with asiago cheese for .59, their signature salad Nuts About Berries and Turkey Spinach Artichoke Panini. Frank had the Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup, the BBQ Chicken salad, and the the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich. They got started on our orders right away, all components were added to our tray, we selected Brownies for dessert and our order came with Belgian Chocolate Covered Strawberries. By the time you pay your tab (ours was gratis on this visit), your order is complete and ready to be whisked away to a cozy table in the dining room.  \n\nWe dug into the soups first, the Tortilla soup is fantastic and loaded with flavor. It was so tasty Frank devoured it before I could snap a photo. The Tomato Basil was good, but less of favorite. It's quite sweet and very heavy on basil flavor. I hear the Wild Mushroom Bisque is not to be missed so I'll try that one next time.\n\nNext, we tried the salads, I had the better of two with Nuts About Berries. It was loaded with fresh berries and topped with cinnamon almonds and lightly dressed with poppyseed dressing. It' a bit sweet, but not cloying so it was enjoyable. The BBQ Chicken salad was loaded with tomatoes, black beans, corn, olives, red onion and dressed with buttermilk ranch. What it lacked was BBQ chicken. There are ten other salads to choose from one is sure to strike your fancy.\n\nUnfortunately, the sandwiches were the weakest link. This is a shame because their Italian Ciabatta bread is really fresh and delicious. The BBQ Pulled Pork tasted more like honey mustard that BBQ. It wasn't a very hearty sandwich. Sadly, the turkey wasn't very good. It tasted like prepackaged deli meat. I prefer freshly sliced deli meats. I expected actual artichokes on the sandwich, but it was a spread. That was my mistake, the menu clearly states a three cheese artichoke spread. I overlooked it. Truly, the bread is so good, I'd try the gourmet sandwiches again. I'm interested in the Asian BBQ Pork and the Vegetarian.\n\nDessert ended the meal on a pleasant note. I love Belgian Chocolate Dipped Strawberries so those alone wooed me, but the brownies were quite good and oh, so decadent. Gooey caramel and candy topped one and the other was more of a bar with coconut, nuts, chocolate and other goodness. \n\nThe staff was incredibly friendly, they gave out dozens of prizes including water bottles and giftcards. Discounts and prizes will also be given out during their Grand Opening celebration on May 18. There are few places where a complete meal can be had for less than ten bucks, but it can be done at Cafe Zupas.","date":"2013-05-07 19:44:18"}

I was not familiar with their brunch set up and imagined a typical brunch menu. We were told we could eat at the buffet and order one entrée from their brunch menu. It wasn't until I started reading the reviews on Yelp that I even knew they had an omelet and waffle station... Our waitress seemed to have a slight attitude ... she didn't notify us, well at least my section of the table (there were around 12 of us )  of additional stations. When our table asked for clarification of entrees  on the menu she had even more of an attitude. I can't find the brunch menu online so I will do my best to describe my entree. It was a layer of French fires, a short rib, egg and then white bbq sauce layered in a bowl. It wasn't clear that this would all come in one bowl and essentially mixed together so when I read the description of the fried egg I asked to have it scrambled. The waitress then told me she can't guarantee that they can scrambled it ... to which I asked her if she could go ask .. instead of telling me she can't guarantee it. \nMy friends ordered Mimosa's and felt as if they weren't coming frequently enough for the price. Another friend ordered an entrée without pork and then even asked the server when he dropped it off if it had pork twice and he said no ... the dish had pork in it. Another friend waited almost 30 mins to receive her food. That was her last straw with the service we received so we asked to speak to manager. Everybody in our party which included around 12 people received half off our bill. Now granted we were a large party and some people came in almost 30 mins after our original start time , I think that the service could have been better.\nI'm glad that the manager rectified the situation , but I don't know if I would go back from brunch. \n\nOn a positive note the buffet was pretty good but it would have been nice to know that I could have gotten an omelet and waffle. I would like to try their lunch menu that looks way more appetizing than what I had for brunch.","date":"2015-03-18 19:20:09"}

Got my materials and started working on the pipes - trying to undo the p-trap joint.\n\nFirst of all - if it's not plastic its metal. If it's metal - it's super difficult to just unscrew even with a wrench or plier.  While doing so I noticed a leak from the sink drainer at the top. Now what I thought was a simple p-trap replacement to resolve a potential clog issue seemed like a much bigger job!\n\nSo researched on Yelp and found E.H. Plumbing. Awesome reviews about service, response and pricing. Gave them a call and was immediately answered by Eric - mind you this is 10am on Friday morning. He gave me a lowdown on price to head over to the condo ~ $125 and then explained what I could be facing when it comes to fixing leaks and clogs for a kitchen sink.\n\nHe got there in couple of hours as promised and inspected the pipes. Discussed it and by then I was determined to replace the metallic pipes with industry accepted plastic PVC. While he wasn't convinced that clog was due to pipes he did suggest replacement into plastic. So got his tools and eventually got all the pipes out. No way I could have accomplished that but he handled it very professionally and gave pointers along the way.\n\nOnce the problem was identified to not be the pipes he attempted to snake the copper pipe running into the building. Source of issue was rusting of pipes in between the building. Anyway cleared the runs and put in the new pipes and now sink was clog free and draining as it should. Eric left right after the work and the total cost was about $200.\n\nDuring the midst of this the neighbors kitchen got flooded. Apparently the building had used a single line for two kitchens. So essentially my condo line met at a T-junction with the neighbors line and then we shared a single line after.\n\nNow here's where the 4 stars came into play for the review. Situation is while clog issue has been fixed with new pipes - can't really turn on sink without flooding neighbors floors. So called Eric and told him about the issue. Now he was great to have returned back to the condo after his other appointment but that's only because his other job was successful. Initially he forecasted waiting till Monday. That's a long time! Job is unfinished and I had already paid him!!\n\nNot sure if he would have come by as he did if his other appointment took longer than expected. That I felt was a slight snag in accountability. \n\nHowever - once he came by - isolated the issue and replaced the neighbors pipes under the sink that blew out for free! \n\nOverall great experience with Eric and E.H. Plumbing.  Will definitely use him again! Thank you Eric!","date":"2015-12-05 12:17:50"}

The staff at this hotel really knows what customer service is all about! \nThis review may be longer than most of my reviews but I really need everyone to understand how much the staff anticipated our needs\/desires.\nLets start with the front desk. I came in early the first day. I do mean early, there breakfast was still going. All I really needed was the shuttle to pick up my rental car, no problem. Told me what time to be in the lobby for the next shuttle, which was less than 20 minutes. So I just waited in the lobby. While I'm sitting there they called me to the desk and handed me my room keys! I'm like are you for real, but sure, that's great. \nI went to pick up my rental car then came back to take things up to my room. These rooms are very spacious. I was thrilled with a microwave and refrigerator as well. Ice machines available on each floor by the elevator. Just how convenient can it get.\nHousekeeping is next. Wow, once again. The first morning we left a note for them to leave a couple of extra coffees. When we returned that night lets just say they made sure we had more than enough, regular and decaf. Everyday it was at least noon or later before we headed out for the day, and our room was still cleaned everyday. The last day, we stayed in the room till 2pm before we left and we returned around 6pm. To our surprise the room had not been refreshed, but we understood and didn't really need anything but coffee. Then a few minutes later housekeeping came by and all was perfect. All this without having to ask for anything.\nOur last day, they where able to let us stay as long as we needed, since they still had availability that night. They just asked us to let them know when we where done.\nThe breakfast is pretty standard at Hampton inn. They always have some sort of egg and protein as well as waffles, cereals and pastries. I do wish that the Hampton chain would do something about the egg\/protien selection.  Very limited and the eggs seem to always we way overcooked with very little flavor. This is a problem with the chain, and not this particulair hotel.   \nMy only complaint is about families with children. I love kids but please make them throw there candy wrappers away. Everyday the pool was littered with candy wrappers, and I know the hotel was cleaning the pool area. Sometimes we have to do our part. \nI see several comments on people making comments about the airport right next door.  Yes, if you are a light sleeper then the planes may just keep you awake, but I believe you would have to be a light sleeper.  If youve ever stayed at a hotel near LAX, then this is nothing compared to them.  \nI will be back to Vegas and I will stay here again.

We have been driving all the way down to Kensington in the past three years to get our Sushi fix so this addition to our local dining is very welcome.  My wife and I dined there with our two year old and it was a very pleasant experience.  The ambience is nice and includes a few classic Japanese style booths along with your regular booths and tables.  We ordered the Bento Box's and they were tasty and fresh.  The salad included the traditional ginger dressing, the miso had substance, the saki sushi (salmon) was fresh.  The ginger pork could have used some crispness and the gyoza was more pastry-like than is commonly served, but overall the food quality and flavour was excellent.  The service was also attentive and friendly including being very accomodating to our two year old with additional avacodo slices.  He enjoyed sitting in the Japanese booth and bopping to the background music.  We went around 1:30pm on a Saturday afternoon and replaced another family and saw one other take out order, so please add to their clientelle and visit Taiyo to keep good Sushi alive in north Calgary.","date":"2010-08-21 20:41:27"}

According to their website (Under Piercing - Process) they will sterilize your jewlery for you and pierce at a discounted price. Being that I am on a budget and have a sensitivity to nickel, I brought in my own titanium nostril screw because I've had a previous Stainless Steel piercing bubble, pop and bleed profusely and I had to take it out, whereas Titanium has been safe for me in the past. However upon arrival I was met with confusion about my inquiry and told that they only use their own jewlery, and that being pierced with their own titanium jewlery costs $95.00. I opted for Stainless Steel again because the girl (did not catch name, sorry!) assured me it was nickel free and that reactions are unusual. So, I hope the previous reaction to the nose ring was my fault somehow. I am honestly not trying to spend $95.00 on anything! I'm not balling like that.\n\nMy piercer was Nic and my experience was fine. He was polite and everything looked tidy. After piercing I was given some aftercare instructions and a small bag of salt.\n\nIt cost $65 to have a nostril pierced here, and I do find that pricey. I went elsewhere to have a nostril done last year and it was half the price. However, I'm not sure how piercing places determine their prices. Being to three different places to attempt the nostril piercing so far, there have not been any differences in friendliness or the apparent cleanliness of the place, while each place is double the price of the next. So I wouldn't discourage people from using this location based on the cost.\n\nOverall my experience was satisfactory and my only complaint would be that the website does not reflect the practices of the business.","date":"2015-04-28 22:00:20"}

The hotel is close to restaurants and shopping which was also a plus. Overall my stay at trump tower was a good experience. The only reason I gave 3 stars was the fact that they held $100 a day for deposit and when I checked out the man at the front desk said it would be released immediately. Well it's Monday and no $200 yet, and when I called to inquire they told me those funds will not released for 3-5 days. So now I'm left with $60 in my account until Wednesday or Friday at the latest.

Fairmount, or 2) Montreal bagels v. NYC style. What I can offer is a whole-hearted endorsement of all things made of carbohydrates. \n\nMontreal bagels are delicious. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a moron, or a liar. They are sweeter than the NYC style, and a lot less doughy. I find that less dough- equals a better carb to cream cheese ratio. \n\nFairmount bagels are wonderful. You will have to wait in line for them- but they are worth it. I ordered a to-go bag of 12. There are a lot of flavors to choose from including: All-dressed, Garlic, sesame, chocolate, cinnamon-raisin, \"a sweet bagel\" (whatever that is), poppy seed, plain, etc. My favorite was the garlic bagel, second places goes to all-dressed. \n\nFairmount does not have a toaster- so you'll have to eat your bagels \"raw\" or bring them home and prepare them. Fairmount sells cream cheese - in a few different varieties, and can direct you to a good lox shop down the street. They also sell day-old bagels at a discount, already helpfully arranged in bags, to the side of the counter.\n\nBagel-sellers speak English. They are excellent at handling complex orders and are efficient at gathering all of your beloved demands. \n\nOpen 24 hours a day. It's a good place to shop for vacation \"presents\" for your jealous friends and family. \n\nLast word of advice: Fairmount bagels keep well in the freezer. If you freeze you bagels- you just need to zap them for approximately 30 seconds- and as if they are fresh again.","date":"2015-10-23 18:04:38"}

Jennifer came, asked us what we wanted, and she walked back and forth in the opposite direction of where the soda machine was at. Another nice gentlemen came to make sure that we were already taken care of, and thinking back we should've switched waiters while we had the chance. Any who, our drinks our finally brought, and we still havent gotten our bread and butter (as promised by Jennifer). So there goes another 15 minutes to get us the bread. My family gets here, and we are all deciding what to eat. Mind you, ive never been there so im having trouble trying to choose an entree. I ask Jennifer what she recommends and she said \"im classy so i like so and so plate\"...like what? Am i too ghetto for you, Jennifer?  so, i order this chipotle pasta thing and when i got it, it was alright. I ate it because i was really hungry but it wasnt the best thing. My niece is telling this waitress that it's my sister's birthday, us expecting for them to sing to her you know, because it's tradition. Nope, Jennifer just looked at her like she was crazy and walked away, didnt even say happy birthday at the most. Fast forwarding to the check, obviously we are all split. So, i personally got the check and split it into number groups. Group 1 was me and my husband, 2 was my sister and her family, so on and so forth. She sees me doing this, and says \"oh awesome thanks for splitting it for me!\" She comes back and says \"so i know you tried helping me but i found an easier way\". Like ok, whatever works for you, Jennifer. She gives us back our checks and they're all messed up............but she found an easier way right? .

I went in once to try on leg pads, and even though I told him that I absolutely wasn't going to be buying anything that day, he spent a good 30 minutes with me. Other employees have also been very helpful with one exception.\n\nThe exception: on two separate occasions the same employee has given me inaccurate information. Both times I was looking at some dirt cheap entry level catching gloves. Both times this guy has come up and told me that it's an incredible deal on top of the line gear. \n\nNow if you know anything about goalie gear, you know that there's a HUGE difference between a $150 entry level glove on a clearance rack and a $450 top of the line glove.

Sorry, Justin.)\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nEdit: I'm knocking off two stars. I had two experiences at this store in the last few months that I was living in Madison that really soured me on the place. \n\n1) I had them install a new pair of cowlings on my skates and they did a lousy job. There were two issues: 1) One of the cowlings was clearly pinched too tight. When I pointed this out, they referred to the fact that it was under warranty instead of trying to make it right. 2) A rivet in the other skate wasn't installed correctly. It sticks up a good quarter of an inch. This was a really, really obvious problem, and I'm deeply annoyed that they didn't get it right.\n\n2) I purchased a very pricy pair of knee guards. One of them burst a seam just a few months after I bought it, but fortunately it was under warranty from the company. I brought this to their attention and waited for a replacement. And waited. And waited. Months went by and nothing was happening. The manager assured me that they would get me a replacement as soon as possible. I assumed that the manufacturer was completely out of stock and that they were making their best efforts to secure the replacement. They weren't. I ended up moving to Pennsylvania and going into another Hockey Giant where I saw those exact same knee guards on display. Ultimately, the Madison store was able to transfer my credit, so I finally got the replacements that I'd waited so long for. It really pissed me off, though, that these knee guards existed in their system and that they didn't figure out a way to get me some in a timely manner.","date":"2016-02-12 01:18:22"}

At last, she was able to book a next day couples massage when that's all my schedule could fit in. Once we got there, the woman at the counter was very nice and guided the way. The lounges (at  least the women's) were nice, clean, and cozy with lockers, showers, hair supplies, and a sauna; though, the magazines could have been better placed so you don't have to bend over and risk exposing breast or genitals to obtain one while sitting and waiting for the therapist. When we got to the room, the ambiance was relaxing and what you would expect for a massage. My boyfriend and I both agree, the massages were great, and much better than a different resort spa we had gone to that I won't mention. That being said, one of the therapists's stomach was gurgling throughout the whole hour; I could even hear it on my end even though it was my boyfriend's therapist. He stated it got to the point where he would try to predict when it would happen again; because, at the end of the gastric rhapsody, a large belch would erupt. This occurred 4-5 times. Nice woman, nice massage, but we were left wondering if she had forgotten to take her GERD medication that morning or if we were both at risk for getting gastro. In addition, my therapist was coughing throughout the massage. There was no nose sniffling, which reassured me it was likely allergies or a post-infectious cough that lingered. Since we are both pretty low-key, we just laughed about it and joked how we may have created a super bug being in a small room complete with upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms (though I'm sure many others would be perturbed). The only real thing that perturbed me is when I went to pay for the massage afterwards. The bill was right, but I received a thank you card for \"Matthew & Sandy.\" That would be fine, except for my name isn't Sandy. I had just spent a couple hundred dollars, if you want to go to the effort of giving a card, at least get the name right. I would have preferred not getting one at all. It's pretty impersonal to have your boyfriend's name with another woman's name on a card after I just paid for it (the reservation name was right, however, and so was the credit card name). Afterwards, we went and relaxed by the pool which was nice. But keep in mind you might have to get food and drinks from the indoor bar because by the time we arrived, they were already doing last call at the pool side bar. P.S.

On the outside of the restaurant is a big sign that says \"FUSION FOOD\".  The place was also described as a typical Japanese cafe.  Have been to Japan three times and there is nothing that indicates a typical cafe except for a tiny place in Osaka that had curry and 5 other things on the menu.  \n\nI would recommend removing that banner.  The food is not fusion and it detracts from what you are really trying to do.  The service here is decent, but I'm still struggling with the typical cafe thing.  The menu is a mix of some Izakaya style dishes...Japanese curry and the Japanese version of Hanbaga, with a Korean pork and kim chee highlighted by some desserts that you might see in a cafe\/coffee shop.  I still have had much better parfaits and desserts.  \n\nHeard the chef\/owner is from Sushi Roku and I wish him the best.  Focus on the food and forget the fusion.  The Japanese Hamburger and the Curry is a great start for the concept.  The creative desserts can be another aspect, but go the extra mile and do something more.  I get the impression of settling on a little of this and that.\n\nI would probably go back once or twice a year unless the food improves.  Get rid of the metal chopsticks as well.  Wooden is preferable in a Japanese establishment.  Consider share plates or chopstick holders as well so your customers have a place to put them rather than directly on the table.","date":"2012-09-10 18:16:31"}

This was the second oil change that I had scheduled. The scheduling was very easy, and I had asked that there be some extra time allotted as the digital display behind the odometer was not changing and I needed help with that. When I arrived, I was sent to the Customer Service and Bert Neal was the Consultant assigned to help me. First off, he told me that he couldn't have the digital display checked as there was not enough time allocated for it... this was after he couldn't figure out who was supposed to be assigned to help me, and it turned out to be him. I told him when I made the appointment 2 weeks earlier, I knew I would be back in Las Vegas and needed that looked at so I had asked for the time to be allotted when I made the appointment. He kept telling me he didn't know what I was talking about and so forth. Anyway, he said he'd look at the car and check it out after the oil change. He didn't have the faintest clue about the car or what I needed looked at and so his time spent there was a complete waste. Also, the oil change was done in about 10 minutes, but the car was brought back to me unwashed and not vacuumed out. I would have thought for a new car, there might be some perk when you're getting your recommended service, like at the Lexus dealership. There was none. Bert then got in the car and proceeded to tell me that the S, T, TR, W, E button was working and I informed him that wasn't even what I was talking about. He had zero clue. He finally took it to Concierge service where the nice young woman immediately showed me how to change the digital display. The last thing I asked was about the center console where your arm rests as the leather started to wrinkle after 6 months. I had asked about it and Bert immediately said it was my fault for using lotion and putting my arm on the arm rest and it wasn't under warranty. He said I could talk to the manager but that it wouldn't be covered. He did tell me I could take the car to St. George, UT, where I now live, but have never had the car for any service and see if they might cover it. I was like, 'why would a dealership, who didn't sell me the car, cover anything and why won't you take care of it here?' Honestly, I was so incredibly disappointed with Bert Neal. I spent 65K on a car that the salesman worked hard to ensure my sale went through well and then some lazy guy who is a sales consultant, could ruin the entire reputation of the Henderson dealership. I had to finally ask Bert if he was going to go get Roger, the Manager, or do I have too? He went to get Roger, and I can tell you, Bert wasn't happy about having to go get me any help. I'm thinking, I've spent a ton of money, I'm a good customer, why do I have to deal with some jerk who was talking condescending to me and treating me like I was an idiot, when he was the one who didn't have a clue what was going on? Roger came out and spoke with me. He was extremely pleasant and wanted to get things fixed. He did not agree with Bert on the lotion issue and informed me how to better take care of that issue. I will say that if I have to have service at the Henderson dealership, I will ask to NOT have Bert Neal work with me. His attitude toward having to look something up or move away from his desk was like I was a big inconvenience. It really does hurt your customer satisfaction to have an employee like that. Also, I would suggest that at the very least, a light vacuum be done of the cars which are in for service that is under warranty, like the Lexus dealership does. I do love the Corvette, but the service behind it has been minimal. Thank you. I feel bad giving a '1' star, but Bert was one of the worst customer service people I've ever dealt with. Roger and the girl from the Concierge were amazing so the '1' star is for the Sales Consultant Bert Neal. Otherwise, I would give the service for the oil change a 3 and Concierge and Management a 5 star.\n\nAn update to this review done on 8-28-2017:  I was able to get the car in for the part and Roger in Management helped with that process.  He was great to work with.  Steve was the new Sales Consultant I worked with and was amazing also. They got the car in, fixed and got me on my way quickly.  Thank you to the great people in management and scheduling, who helped to get this issue resolved for me.  I appreciate it so much.","date":"2017-08-28 19:15:31"}

The soup I ordered was very good.

A few weeks ago I had finished up at the gym that left me with a handsome appetite and ordered carry-out from Hunan Convetry - first and last time.  \n\nI ordered crab rangoons, shrimp with honey walnut, Kung Pao beef, and pork chow fun ... (I was a little *hungry* :-P). It was a carry out order, and they were promptly ready for pick-up. I got back home super excited and immediately inhaled the rangoons; you can't really screw those up: it's fried wontons with cream cheese and sweet chili sauce. \n\nI don't think my palate is salt-biased, but this was the first time (in a long time) that I ADDED salt, among other things, to my shrimp and pork entrees. Chow fun ranks pretty high on my list of comfort foods - the broad doughy noodles full of flavor I expected were nothing more than tasteless oil-laden folds of pasta. I have my food issues, always cleaning my plate, always keeping leftovers, and never wasting (there are too many hungry people out there for me to be cavalier). Well, these two entrees ended up in the trash (did I mention I was STARVING when I ordered?). As for the beef, I tried my best to salvage my $$$ by re-purposing it the next day.\n\nI would have done better picking up a frozen entree by Ina Garten or Trader Joe's.","date":"2014-06-11 18:24:24"}
