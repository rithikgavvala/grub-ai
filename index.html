        Background
    </h4>
    <p>
        For our project, we decided to look at the current restaurant rating system- we found out that a restaurant’s rating has a significant impact on its potential revenue. More specifically, a 1-star increase in a restaurant’s Yelp rating can lead to a more than 9% increase in revenue. Due to this impact, we wanted to figure out ways to get a more accurate “5-star review” of a restaurant based on the latest data. Fortunately, social media has provided us a way to gain insight into how people feel about restaurants and menu-items in real-time. Introducing grub.ai, a machine learning system that predicts a restaurant’s review based on real-time social-media sources.

        In order for our team to consider our project successful there are a couple objectives that we are trying to achieve. The first of which is to develop a model that given any single yelp review is able to accurately predict the rating of it. We can test this because we have the data for each review in the form of a JSON object and we can simply cross-reference our model’s prediction with the rating given in the data. The second objective that our team will be trying to complete would be to achieve high accuracy in terms of sentiment analysis on tweets regarding rating of a restaurant. These are the results that we are trying to achieve.

    <p>
        In thinking about the outcome of our project, the best outcome would be to have an accurate model that can predict the rating of any review that we pass into it. And thinking about next steps, our goal is to expand the model into application that gives an accurate rating for restaurants and even specific food items.  This true rating system would be far more accurate because, rather than relying on outdated reviews, you can actually have a rating system that is decided based on far more recent information, like twitter posts. This rating system solves the massive problem of having lack of information when looking at restaurants, as well as the common disparity between the opinions stated on the internet, and the current thoughts of people towards these restaurants. And expanding on this idea even more, we could see this idea being implemented within any entertainment and recreational buildings, basically anything that has a review system already in place.
